  <chapter*|Elements of Mathematical Quantum Mechanics>

  <notes-abstract|These lectures are delivered in the context of the TCC
  course offer of HT 2024.>

  <with|font-series|bold|Schedule.> 9:30 to 11:30 (BST) Wednesdays via MS
  Teams.

  This course aims to introduce the basic setting of quantum mechanics from a
  conceptual point of view, starting with an algebraic axiomatization of the
  process of measuring quantities in a physical experiment (introduced
  essentially by I.<nbsp>Segal), and proceeding to motivate the need for
  non-commutativity from experimental observations. Quantum mechanics emerges
  then as the dynamics of a non-commutative probability space with
  Heisenberg's commutation relations as describing a \Pmaximally
  non-commutative\Q situation. If time permits we will cover the construction
  of quantum dynamics via Euclidean path integrals.

  A rough outline of the topics is as follows: \ 

  <with|font-series|bold|QM as a theory of measurement.> The Stern-Gerlach
  experiment and quantum phenomena. Mathematical model of a physical system.
  Operational definition and properties of observables and states. Duality,
  algebraic structure. C*-algebras. Classical mechanics from commutative
  observation al Example of the description of a classical mechanical system.\ 

  <with|font-series|bold|Elements of the theory of C* algebras.> Definition
  and first properties, spectrum of an element, spectral radius,
  multiplicative functionals, Abelian Banach algebras, maximal ideals and
  multiplicative functionals, Gelfand transform, Gelfand-Naimark theorem on
  the structure of commutative C* algebras, functional calculus. Properties
  of positive elements, positive linear functionals. Gelfand\UNaimark\USegal
  representations, representations of non-commutative C* algebras, the
  non-commutative Gelfand\UNaimark theorem, irreducible representations and
  pure states, pure state of abelian algebras are multiplicative,
  probabilistic interpretation, folium of a representation, Fell's theorem
  and physical interpretation

  <with|font-series|bold|Non-commutativity and quantum phenomena.> necessity
  of non-commutativity to describe quantum phenomenology, Heisenberg's
  indetermination principle and Planck's constant, Schrödinger-Robertson
  inequality, canonical commutation relations (CCR), impossibility to realize
  the CCR with bounded operators, probabilistic phenomena in non-commutative
  algebras, construction of discrete systems of complementary observables.
  Canonical commutation relations<nbsp>as limits of discrete ones.\ 

  <with|font-series|bold|The Weyl algebra.> Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula
  and relation with Heisenberg's commutation relations. Observables as
  *-homomorphism and unitary representations of R on Hilbert space.
  Heisenberg<nbsp>group and von Neumann theorem on the uniqueness of
  irreducible<nbsp>regular representations of Weyl algebra in finite
  dimensions, Schrödinger representation, irreducibility. Determination of
  the vacuum in the Schrödinger representation. Gaussian representation of
  Weyl relations. Reducible representations.

  <with|font-series|bold|Dynamics of a quantum system.> Unitary
  representation of weakly continuous automorphism on an invariant state.
  Link between unitary groups and self-adjoint semigroups. Energy operator.
  Semigroups and *-homomorphism, Bernstein theorem on totally monotone
  functions. Ground states and Wightman functions.

  <with|font-series|bold|Euclidean approach.> <with|font-shape|italic|(if
  time permits)> Axioms for Wightman functions. Axioms for Schwinger
  functions and the reconstruction theorem. Reflection positivity. Reflection
  positivity for Markov processes and construction or reflection positive
  processes via SDEs.
