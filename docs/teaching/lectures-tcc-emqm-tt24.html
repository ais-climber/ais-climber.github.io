      This course aims to introduce the basic setting of quantum mechanics
      from a conceptual point of view, starting with an algebraic
      axiomatization of the process of measuring quantities in a physical
      experiment (introduced essentially by I.&nbsp;Segal), and proceeding to
      motivate the need for non-commutativity from experimental observations.
      Quantum mechanics emerges then as the dynamics of a non-commutative
      probability space with Heisenberg's commutation relations as describing
      a &ldquo;maximally non-commutative&rdquo; situation. If time permits we
      will cover the construction of quantum dynamics via Euclidean path
      integrals.
    </p>
    <p>
