      Literate programming was invented by Knuth to provide a literary work
      which would <i>explain</i> (unroll / open wide in front of us) a
      computer program by telling a story about it. It's about following a
      thread where a plot, made of chunks of the actual code of the program,
      is gradually unveiled. Collecting chunk after chunk, a special utility
      program can reconstitute the entirety of the code to be then given back
      to the computer, for execution or compilation. A monologue that
      occasionally becomes a dialogue. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've encountered many times examples of literate programs. The most
      famous is the TeX program itself, which take life as a narration in the
      homonymous book &ldquo;TeX the program&rdquo; (<a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/info/knuth-pdf">here</a> for a
      the full collection of PDF files and <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/knuth-pdf/tex/tex.pdf">here</a> for the literate
      <class style="font-variant: small-caps">Cweb</class> sources for TeX). Some of them, especially
      the short ones, are quite unimpressive. Look <a href="https://literateprograms.org/literateprograms_welcome.html">here</a> for a
      whole Wiki of literate programs to get an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from TeX (and Metafont) other large programs are maintained as
      literate works: <a href="http://www.axiom-developer.org">Axiom</a>, the book <a href="https://pbr-book.org">&ldquo;Physically
      based rendering&rdquo;</a>, the <a href="https://drh.github.io/lcc/"><tt class="verbatim">lcc</tt></a>
      retargetable ANSI C compiler, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139172974">&ldquo;Lisp In Small
      Pieces&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://github.com/daly/literateclojure">&ldquo;Clojure in Small Pieces&rdquo;</a>
      (see also <a href="https://github.com/robleyhall/clojure-small-pieces">here</a> for context on this last book).
    </p>
    <h3 id="auto-2">Literate programs are human-specific super-languages<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h3>
    <p>
      However my brain &ldquo;clicked&rdquo; when I discovered <a href="https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/peg.md"><tt
      class="verbatim">peg.md</tt></a> by <a href="https://github.com/kragen">K. J. Sitaker</a>. It is a small
      MarkDown document that gives a literate implementation of <i>parsing
      expression grammars</i> (PEGs) together with a meta compiler implemented
      in Javascript. What I found remarkable is the expressivity of the
      literate style to convey <i>complex interactions</i> among different
      computer idioms and dense representations of ideas, even when reduced to
      the essence of some tricks in a markdown text file. The text file <a
      href="https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/peg.md"><tt class="verbatim">peg.md</tt></a> contains the code of various versions
      of the Javascript PEG compiler, and a PEG meta-compiler written in
      itself, and the Makefile which extracts from the literate document a
      bootstrapping Javascript PEG compiler and use it to compile the PEG
      metacircular description of the PEG compiler progressively in two
      versions with larger set of features. Another Markdown file <a href="https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/handaxeweb.md"><tt
      class="verbatim">handaxeweb.md</tt></a> is the literate implementation of the Lua
      script which extracts the program files from the Markdown documents. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This made me realize that the expressivity of the literate style is both
      towards humans and towards the machine. A single literate
      <i>document</i> contains the code of various programs, maybe even
      written in different languages, which are gathered together and made
      speak to each other in ways in which is not possible in standard
      programming environments, where each program lives in a separate file
      while, usually, certain parts of a program here have their <i>raison
      d'&ecirc;tre</i> in other parts of another program there. Think of
      HTML/Javascript/CSS plus maybe some code in C++ compiled to Webassembly
      and which has to interact with Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this sense literate programming moves away from usual file-based
      programming in a direction completely orthogonal to what <a href="https://github.com/dbanay/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>,
      <a href="https://pharo.org">Squeak/Pharo</a>, <a href="https://newspeaklanguage.org">NewSpeak</a>, <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org">Unison</a> or
      some image-based Lisp system does (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://interlisp.org">Interlisp/Medley</a>).
      In these systems everything is programmed in a single language: the
      living program is its own documentation and the narrative thread is
      provided by the user's interactive exploration of the hyperlinked web of
      &ldquo;materialized code&rdquo;. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A literate document is, instead, an heterodox medium where policies can
      be put in place to make different languages coexist, including natural
      language, and where a thread is provided by the writer (or maybe better
      the &ldquo;editor&rdquo; or &ldquo;director&rdquo;) who supervise and
      coordinate the various voices in order to provide a coherent and
      synesthetic intellectual experience to the reader, while still being
      able to distill automatically the various &ldquo;voices&rdquo; into
      different files for the use in a computer system.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that this characteristic of LP is not usually valued or even
      considered, see the discussion in the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LiterateProgramming">c2 wiki</a> or in the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Wikipedia page</a> or in the <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com">literateprogramming.com</a>
      and <a href="https://softpanorama.org/SE/literate_programming.shtml">softpanorama.org</a> websites. All these expositions
      collapse the idea of literate document towards a single programming
      language. LP implementations are usually also targeted to a single
      language with few exceptions (e.g. <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/"><class style="font-variant: small-caps">Noweb</class></a>)
      in which case the stress is towards the universality more than towards
      the openness of the system. However, as the <a href="https://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/master/peg.md"><tt class="verbatim">peg.md</tt></a>
      example, in its minimality, masterfully shows, the liberating power of
      LP is in its complete malleability in providing <b>metacircular
      description of complex computer systems</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So while certain languages implement domain-specific sub-languages in
      order to better model domain-specific (human) knowledge (see e.g. the
      language-oriented programming of Racket), literate programs are then
      (human) <b>domain-specific super-languages</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      While TeX was born as a literate program, <class style="font-variant: small-caps">Axiom</class>
      <i>is becoming</i> (or better, want to, see this <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2023-03/msg00003.html">message</a> of
      Daly in the <tt class="verbatim">axiom-developer</tt> mailing list) one because
      Daly felt the need to document the valuable millions lines of code
      constituting the program and implementing sophisticate algorithms for
      computer algebra. So LP programming has also a role of <b>explanation
      and exploration device</b>, which allows open&ndash;source developer
      communities to consolidate and gather the knowledge acquired by studying
      and traversing exogenous codebases. Daly advocated this pedagogical use
      of LP with &ldquo;<a href="https://github.com/robleyhall/clojure-small-pieces">Clojure in Small Pieces</a>&rdquo; and <a
      href="https://github.com/robleyhall/clojure-small-pieces/blob/master/README.md">says</a>:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 77.321376014376px; margin-right: 77.321376014376px">
      <p>
        Since I'm studying the details of the inner workings of Clojure this
        seemed to be the right time to experiment with a literate form. I have
        put together the beginnings of a Clojure in Small Pieces book.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      As Daly again points out in the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0PQDVTP4A">&ldquo;LP in the
      large&rdquo;</a>, big open source systems <i>need</i> literate
      programming to thrive and survive through time. Writing is the
      technology which allows us to transmit knowledge across time and space.
      Literate programs contains also the &ldquo;why&rdquo; some code exists
      or is modeled in some way instead of another, and also point out logical
      links among different parts of the code, which may not be materialized
      via the specific programming language in use.

    <h3 id="auto-3">Literate programming in TeXmacs<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h3>
    <p>
      TeXmacs as a LP tools has many advantages over more classical solutions.
      First of all, there is no need of &ldquo;tangling&rdquo;, a TeXmacs
      document is &ldquo;alive&rdquo; and does not need to be compiled. Also a
      TeXmacs document is active, because can invoke Scheme scripts or other
      plugins which provide then interactive features and in particular can
      contain its very own &ldquo;tangling&rdquo; code, possibly modified and
      customized for the specific kind of document at hand. TeXmacs literate
      coding is self-contained and self-expandable and targeted to human
      fruition even more thanks to the user-centered design of the TeXmacs
      document system and user interface.
    </p>
    <h3 id="auto-4">A Literate TeXmacs?<span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.texmacs.org">TeXmacs</a> is also a large computer system. Not a single
      program, but a web of interconnected programs written in multiple
      languages: C++, Scheme, TeXmacs macro language for the styles and the
      packages and small DSLs for specific tasks (e.g. description of virtual
      glyphs, UI, etc..). All these pieces have to work together quite tightly
      for the system to work properly. Especially so because TeXmacs user
      interface (written mostly in Scheme) is tightly integrated both with the
      typesetter (written mostly in C++) and with the various typesetting
      macros and style packages (written in the TeXmacs macro language).
      Moreover it depends on various external libraries which have to be
      integrated via the usual wodoo of Makefiles and system specific
      configurations. And this without considering that export to HTML and
      LaTeX also means that we need some support files written in CSS,
      Javascript or LaTeX, which again have to be carefully coordinated with
      the exporting routines. Another complexity layer then come from the fact
      that the plugins which allow TeXmacs to communicate with the external
      world are written in a variety of languages, and despite the wire
      protocol allows a shallow coordination, they have to be also maintained
      alongside the main sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I've tried to explain above, the crucial features I see in LP are
      two:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          a metacircular description of complex computer systems via a (human)
          domain&ndash;specific super-language
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          an explanation and exploration device
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      They fit perfectly with the above description of TeXmacs. We need a tool
      which allow the community to obtain a shared understanding of the
      various sources in their interrelation and of the principles, design
      decisions and specific tradeoffs present in the codebase. TeXmacs itself
      is a document preparation system, so a literate development of TeXmacs
      can be metacircular in a very tight way: one can envisage that the
      TeXmacs system can be described by a TeXmacs literate document
      comprising all the various sources codes in a unique &ldquo;book&rdquo;
      which tells the story (or a story) of the program. In this vision there
      are no other source files than a web of hyperlinked TeXmacs documents. A
      Scheme script can extract the usual arborescence of OS files to be feed
      to the various compilers or to be assembled in runtime resources. The
      build process can be described alongside the system specific changes
      which can be even implemented in more flexible ways because the
      parametrization of the code is not in full control of the LP scripts.
      This will reduce the need for complex build systems, at the price of
      having available a bootstrapping avenue in the form of some
      cross-platform support or small Scheme interpreter which can
      &ldquo;weave&rdquo; the relevant sources to compile a first runnable
      version of TeXmacs.
