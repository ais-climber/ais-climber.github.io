    <with|font-shape|italic|TeXmacs: WYSIWYG in Science Writing, and Why it
    Matters>

    This will be a blog post in part about my personal experience with
    TeXmacs, and in part an

    argument that TeXmacs is now mature enough and useful enough to be
    adopted by scientific

    research communities for writing and publishing. The main points I would
    like to make are:

    \;

    <\itemize>
      <item>Different people work more effectively and productively with
      different tools. LaTeX has

      clear drawbacks beyond the steep learning curve: lots of noise &
      clutter in the source, a mental

      \Pdistance\Q away from the writing, if something breaks the whole
      document won't render

      (errors) are not local, some of these reasons make presentations +
      posters frustrating to

      design

      \;

      <item>TeXmacs (and LyX) offers the power and spirit of LaTeX for people
      who wish to move\ 

      towards a WYSIWYG system. I will argue that this is better than losing
      those same people to\ 

      less ideal workarounds, including Word, markdown + mathjax, etc. Also
      talk here about

      Auxtex, which is nearly an acceptable solution for me (though the
      beauty of TeXmacs being

      literally WYSIWYG means I won't go back when I can help it.)

      \;

      <item>My personal experience using TeXmacs, how much grief it's saved
      me

      \;

      <item>What's currently missing for its widespread adoption (style
      files, synchronous work).

      Discuss the current status of these things.
    </itemize>
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    A tutorial for an advanced undergraduate or graduate student doing
    epistemic logic. The\ 

    guide is \PHow to Interpret your epistemic logic operator\Q, i.e., how do
    you determine

    whether a <math|\<box\>> or <math|\<forall\>x> is necessity or knowledge
    or belief or evidence or update or learning, <text-dots>

    Basically my insight is: find the nearest well-known operator
    <with|font-shape|italic|below> yours, and interpret your\ 

    operator as that one plus some properties. (I should also give a map of
    well-known

    epistemic operators.)
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Write about my personal experiences using proof assistants (Agda and
    Lean). My main

    takeaway is that I find them indispensible for 1) understanding proofs
    better, and 2) getting

    difficult definitions right when designing new definitions. But I tend to
    stop using them

    when the proofs get trickier.
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    <with|font-shape|italic|A Logic as a Cognitive Agent>

    Answer Genevive's question from earlier\Vbasically, explain how logic is
    useful in cognitive

    science. Give a number of success stories where logic was used to
    demonstrate a surprising

    feature of cognition or reasoning (or at least, surprising what we can
    model computationally).
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Start cataloguing different logics. (Each could get it's own box, a lot
    like this document.)

    Eventually I'd like to turn this into a Wiki \Pcomplexity zoo\Q
    containing detailed information

    about logics and their relationships, emphasizing a model-theory POV.
  </idea|<with|color|#FBBC05|<aw|laptop-code|1fn>>
  <with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Start cataloguing different dynamic updates for belief revision and
    learning. Also catalogue

    different axioms and properties that belief revision / learning operators
    can have or not have.

    My goal is to eventually write this up into a handbook that offers a ton
    of examples (I want to

    design it like a biologist's field notebook, with pictures and features
    for each \Pcreature.\Q)
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>
  <with|color|#34A853|<aw|book|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Modify the <hlink|Modal Logic Playground|https://github.com/rkirsling/modallogic>
    so that it offers choice of model/semantics, and also so

    that it supports dynamic update and single-stepping through a formula
    with updates.
  </idea|<with|color|#FBBC05|<aw|laptop-code|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Make a style file for a computer science conference (e.g. ICLR), and
    write up a tutorial for

    using TeXmacs to typeset the document. Request to the conference or
    journal that I can

    submit using TeXmacs.
  </idea|<with|color|#FBBC05|<aw|laptop-code|1fn>>
  <with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    I read a meme / watched a video once about a card game that \Pglues\Q all
    other card games\ 

    together, so that cards from different card games can be used in 1-v-1
    play against each other.

    It would be fun to develop this game and write a blog post about it
    <aw|smile|0.9fn>
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    A guide to boycotting companies that have funded or endorsed the Trump
    administration.

    When I learned that boycotting is far more effective than protest, and of
    the dangers involved

    in protesting (e.g., being framed for illegal property damage or deaths),
    I realized that others

    new to policital activism might not be aware of these things. The whole
    point here is for me

    to give a data analysis where I list all of those companies that
    contributed, and all of the

    brands & services that are included in those (including name brands). Of
    course, not

    everyone has the resources or ability to boycott, but I want to stress
    that it's our obligation

    to <with|font-shape|italic|if> we can.

    \;

    (I may have to convince the reader that this is really a movement worth
    boycotting, too!)
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    A short blog about why you (American citizen) should vote, especially if
    you're in a\ 

    demographic that historically does not. My angle here is:

    <\enumerate>
      <item> Your vote does not carry a lot of weight. It is between two
      choices, both of which suck, and

      if you're in a state that votes against yours (e.g., South Carolina),
      you always lose.

      <item> But you <with|font-shape|italic|are> able to influence who those
      choices end up being. The main way is by voting

      in local elections and primaries, which very very few people do (so
      your individual vote

      carries much more power). The second way is that
      <with|font-shape|italic|future> politicians take great care in

      trying to appeal to demographics that do vote, and your vote signals
      that your demographic

      will vote in the future. (It's also been shown that politicians do in
      fact make good on most

      of their campaign promises, despite general attitudes.)
    </enumerate>
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    A nostalgic trip down memory lane, where I talk about my past game
    development as a

    teen and a slime forums review that touched my heart. (It's alright if
    this is written more like

    a tiny memoir.)
  </idea|<with|color|#4285F4|<aw|edit|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    During a game of Hanabi, Dia (from cognitive science) and I were talking
    about certain kinds

    of information exchanges where once you say something, you can't take it
    back (you can't

    revert to the state where it wasn't said or known at all). In an
    epistemic logic context, what

    kinds of updates are \Pneutralizable\Q (able to be \Ptaken back
    completely\Q), and what aren't?

    \;

    In other words, in which epistemic logics can we express the phrase \PI
    take it back\Q or \Pforget\ 

    I said that\Q?
  </idea|<with|color|#EA4335|<aw|comment|1fn>>>

  <\idea>
    Out in the world, people use the word \Pbelief\Q to refer to various
    degrees of belief, from

    \PI believe you'll make good on your promise\Q to hard convictions like
    \PI believe that current

    politics are a result of angels and demons waging a war.\Q Most people
    accept that you can

    change weak beliefs like the former, but many consider changing
    entrenched beliefs like the

    latter to be difficult or even impossible.

    \;

    I am not aware of any work in epistemic logic that reflects this fact:
    <with|font-shape|italic|different types of belief are>

    <with|font-shape|italic|more or less difficult to change>. Say I consider
    an existing approach to graded belief epistemic

    logic. Can I compare / differentiate different update policies by their
    ability to (in one-step,

    or possibly iterated over time) change beliefs at different levels? If
    there is no difference in

    how difficult it is to change at certain levels, this is an issue with
    the model itself (since reality

    reflects the difference)!
