Obsidian setup:

### All Items
- **PhD Milestones**
	- **Thesis Proposal**   *(PRIORITY FOR AUGUST 2024)*
		- [ ] For writing thesis: Print and put in a small binder every bit of writing I've done during my PhD that I am proud of. (All four papers, grant proposal I did early on, grant proposal I did later, grant proposal I am writing with Nina, thesis proposal, old notes on completeness with K and Kdownarrow, extended proofs, the most updated FLAIRS with corrections, my quals exam writeups, my quals exam talk, every talk I've given, abstracts for talks (especially LIRa and AAAI talks), posters) --- get every voice I've ever used to guide me.
	- [ ] Do an audit of my Masters degree & submit by deadline (late december usually)
- **Presentations**   *(PRIORITY FOR AUGUST 2024)*
- **Job Applications**   *(PRIORITY FOR AUGUST 2024)*
	- [ ] Get a haircut
	- [ ] Take a new photo for my website, gruvbox sepia colors by blackboard
	- [ ] Fix the color scheme on my website to be fully gruvbox
	- [ ] Pick 2 postdoc postings and write a cover letter / research statement for it
	- [ ] Email 5 people I know asking if their institution will be hiring for postdocs this upcoming year / what sources of money they're aware of (ask for *advice*)
- **Teaching**   (class planning, grading, course registration)
- **Networking**   (emails, calls, website, and organizing)
- **Socializing**   (attending talks, going to tea time / grad socials)
- **Main Track Work**   (research notebook, paper writing, mathematics, and programming)
	- **Axioms for Learning and Induction; Polya's Induction**
	- **The Modelling Power of Neural Networks**
		- [ ] Patch up the issues with the static-level construction proofs.  Make an important note here --- the double negation makes this **plain fucking tricky**, it took us months to get the details right!  That means *even the basic results are non-trivial!*
		- [ ] Define specific upgrade operators for each class of model!  We have: **Rel**** - announcement/conditionalization & arrow update; **Plaus**** - radical & conservative reorderings (what do these look like in Rel?); **Net**** - Hebbian learning is the most well-understood, note that our framework only considers supervised update that is reducible to unsupervised, which is an open question for gradient descent; **Nbhd**** - evidence revision
		- [ ] Try to prove a really basic dynamic inclusion: **Rel*** -> **Net***
	- **Neighborhood Models & Descriptive Complexity**
		- [ ] Fill in basic definitions/background before starting on any proofs
	- **Neural Network Models for First-Order Logic**
		- [ ] Start a new notes .tex file!! :D  State the problem, math background, and my thoughts (lifting modal -> FOL the way van Benthem does).  Also, mention other neuro-symbolic methods such as Logic Tensor Networks that use quantifiers, explain how this is different (we prove soundness, and in some cases completeness) -- but think about how I could use this to prove soundness for LTNs.
	- **A Dynamic Logic for Gradient Descent**
		- [ ] Start a new notes .tex file!! :D  State the problem, math background, and my thoughts (define gradient descent, supervised upgrade, etc., then pose questions --- e.g. can we prove a 'success' theorem?  Should we consider one round of upgrade, or a fixed-point over a dataset?  Can we prove gold-theorem results about gradient descent this way?)
- **Arxiv**   (backlog of papers to put on Arxiv with full proofs)
	- [ ] FLAIRS Arxiv paper + proofs + corrections
	- [ ] AAAI Reduction paper + proofs + run a reduction simulation to double-check termination
	- [ ] AAAI Sizes of Sets paper
- **Reading**
	- [ ] Make a list of "classic" papers/books in dynamic logic + neuro-symbolic AI that I should try to understand
- **Finances**   (bills, insurance, debt, emergency spending)
	- [ ] Get a parking permit for fall (-$48.75 for the shit tier, -$142.10 for the decent one)
	- [ ] Get a new bumper cover for the car (-$130)
	- [ ] Calculate out how much I would hope to get from a FAFSA loan. This will include my student fees I've racked up so far ($4127), a little bit of savings built up for emergencies, and anticipated moving costs.
	- [ ] Fill out FAFSA form to apply for a federal loan, hopefully subsidized, that will cover my $4000 :(  (+4127ish debt)
- **Health**   (doctors, dentist, and the health of others)
	- [ ] Contact the two cancer researchers at IU to set up a chat with Pop Pop
	- [ ] Look into dental insurance
	- [ ] Schedule a dentist appointment for Sabrina

	- [x] Outline LIRa Talk, part 1
	- [x] Make LIRa Talk part 1, "The Modelling Power of Neural Networks"  (Restrict it to part 1, the takeaway being "Neural networks can be treated like models in logic -- let's take this as far as it can go!" )  **Talk on: SEPTEMBER 5th**

- **Job Applications**   *(PRIORITY FOR AUGUST 2024)*
	- [x] Rewrite webpage bio + CV bio to say:  I am a computer scientist and logician studying the foundations of machine learning and cognition.  I'm especially interested in issues at the intersection of neural network learning, belief revision, dynamic epistemic logic, and descriptive complexity.  My current (thesis) work is on the theory of neuro-symbolic AI, where I use insights from logic to better understand and control the behavior of neural networks, especially as they learn over time.  In the process of doing this work, I've come to believe that logics -- especially dynamic logics of update and learning -- offer a fresh perspective on two of the most critical issues in artificial intelligence: neural network verification and the possibility of AI alignment.
