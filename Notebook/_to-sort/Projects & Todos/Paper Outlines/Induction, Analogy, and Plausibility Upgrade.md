[Technical Paper targeting WoLLiC Community]

**Goals:**
1. Introduce the dynamical ideas hidden in Polya's "Induction and Analogy"; he is proposing different criteria for plausibility upgrade operators, and I'd like to introduce those ideas to this community.
2. Formalize *specific upgrade operators* that meet these criteria (inductive, analogical, etc.)!  Try to prove reduction axioms/completeness for each operator.  If possible, see if an existing upgrade operator works instead (for any given criterion).

**Keep to this limited scope!  This is just meant to show the community a shiny rock I found!**

**Paper Outline:**
1. Introduction
2. Background
	- The Dynamics of Plausibility Upgrade
	- George Polya on Induction and Analogy
3. Inductive Plausibility Upgrades
4. Analogical Plausibility Upgrades
5. An Example (of some sort, that illustrates the benefits of inductive/analogical upgrades)
6. Conclusions and Future Work
