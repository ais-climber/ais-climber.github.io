A collection of (internet) advice that I tend to look back at and reflect on.

### Little things I've seen people do that make a community/space more inviting
- At the IU math department, Clay brings cookies to the math lounge for everyone. It's nice, because most math people forget to eat for long periods of time anyway. Contrast that to the IU computer science department, which is essentially a food desert and doesn't have many free snacks (the occasional after-seminar leftovers, but nothing consistent. The consistency is key.)

**Question:** Obtaining academic positions after doing research in logic
**Answer** (by Henry):
The perception, at least within logic, is that finding research positions in logic is even harder than in most specialities in mathematics - most research hiring is restricted to a specialty, and there are rarely new positions created in mathematical logic.

I'm not sure how true that perception is. As far as I can tell, every field perceives hiring as very tight. There are more qualified people than available jobs in all fields of math; there are fewer positions in logic than, say, algebra, but there are also fewer new PhD's in logic, and I don't know of any data on how the actual ratios compare. But it's certainly hard to get an academic position in logic, and every year very good researchers decide to give up pursuing academic positions.

My impression is that logicians do slightly better than the average mathematician at getting positions at schools that are less research oriented - schools that are hiring based mostly on teaching ability, but want their professors to also be doing some research. (Partially, I think, because those schools often want people who can teach a variety of undergrad classes, and many logicians these days are trained to be able to do that.) But that obviously depends on being a very good teacher.

Regarding applied logic, it's _very_ rare these days for someone with a math PhD to get hired to an interdisciplinary position, at least in the US. Someone who's already established can sometimes can an honorary position in another department, but they still have to be hired (and eventually tenured) by their home department. I think that's different in Europe, where there's a lot more mathematical logic going on in CS departments.
