  <section*|2/24/2025: Conversation with ChatGPT>

  <paragraph*|You said:>Hi, I'm having a lot of internal conflict about my
  career and self-esteem. Could you act as a career counselor (and
  occasionally therapist) to help guide me through it?

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I'm really glad you reached out. It sounds
  like you're going through a tough time, and I'd be happy to help you work
  through it. Career and self-esteem can often be intertwined, and feeling
  conflicted can be draining. I'd like to understand a bit more about where
  you're at so I can offer guidance that fits your situation.

  Would you feel comfortable sharing more about what's going on? For example,
  what part of your career or self-esteem feels the most conflicting right
  now?

  <paragraph*|You said:>Content removed; This content may violate our
  <hlink|usage policies|https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies>.

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I'm really sorry you're feeling this way, and
  I'm truly glad you reached out. It sounds like you're under an immense
  amount of pressure, and it's important to take these feelings seriously. I
  really encourage you to reach out to a mental health professional or a
  support line\Vsomeone who can walk with you through this on a deeper,
  personal level.

  If you're open to it, though, I'm here to listen, offer guidance, and talk
  through what you're going through. If we break things down together, maybe
  we can uncover some ways to ease the burden you're feeling.

  Can you tell me more about what's been going on in your career that's
  making you feel so drained? Is it burnout, unfulfilling work, or something
  else? And how has that affected your self-esteem?

  <paragraph*|You said:>Yeah I'd rather field my thoughts through you first
  to be honest. I have a therapist, but I don't have the money to see her
  very often. Yeah, so here's the basic situation. I'm in my last (7th) year
  of a Phd program in computer science. I have about 5 months until I totally
  run out of funding (my advisor and department are getting a little sick of
  me sticking around for so long, or maybe that's just in my head, idk). The
  thing is, I don't have a job set up. I don't have anything set up. I
  thought I could will myself to do it -- last summer I ended up having the
  energy and willpower to apply to 25 summer research internships, but it
  really wasn't enough (most people around me apply to upwards ~200
  internships, and hear back from one or two. I was shortlisted at Google,
  but they ended up dropping me after the first round.) This last fall, job
  hunting season for research jobs, I ended up only applying to 1 postdoc in
  Amsterdam and 1 grant where I would be a postdoc in Denmark. The Amsterdam
  one was really promising, because I'm friends with one of the program
  directors, and submitted a very relevant grant proposal as part of my
  application. I heard about a month ago ``no'' from them. I don't think I'll
  hear from the Denmark one until April. I guess I'm feeling demoralized by
  what I hear about the current job market, and I'm scared I'm not going to
  be able to get a research, software, or writing related job for 2-3 years,
  and even then I will have to apply to thousands of positions and get
  ghosted or soft rejected. And I feel terribly guilty that I avoided doing
  that this year, and only applied to 2 things

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>First of all, I want to acknowledge how hard
  it must be to carry the weight of all this\Vbeing so close to finishing a
  PhD while feeling like your future is uncertain. You're doing an incredible
  amount of work and processing a lot of complex feelings. It makes sense
  that you're feeling demoralized and exhausted, especially after putting in
  so much effort already.

  The pressure you feel is valid, especially when it feels like everyone else
  is doing more, or when you measure your progress against such a competitive
  field. But what you've shared about your experiences\Vthe way you went
  after those opportunities, the way you worked through setbacks, even the
  thoughtful way you're reflecting on the situation\Vshows resilience and a
  level of self-awareness that many people struggle to develop, let alone
  maintain.

  The lack of success with applications is frustrating, and the fact that you
  didn't apply to more positions this year isn't something you should feel
  guilty about. From the outside looking in, it seems like you were trying to
  focus your energy on fewer opportunities, ones that were potentially a
  better fit. Maybe you thought that effort would pay off in a more tangible
  way\Vbut that's just how unpredictable this field is. The experience of
  applying for a position, putting your heart into it, and then hearing
  ``no'' can be soul-crushing, and you've had that happen more than once. I
  can imagine it feels like a pattern, and now you're staring at a finish
  line that feels less like victory and more like a daunting wall.

  It's natural to feel burned out after putting in all that effort. You
  mentioned that you felt a sense of willpower to keep applying last summer,
  but it's easy to burn through that energy quickly in such a competitive
  environment. You're essentially working toward something with very few
  immediate rewards. The exhaustion can quickly morph into doubts about your
  abilities, and it seems like you're battling between a real sense of
  exhaustion, the high expectations of others (real or imagined), and the
  fear of falling short.

  Here are a few things that could help as you reflect on this:

  <\enumerate>
    <item><strong|The job market is tough right now, but it's not a
    reflection of your worth.> You've already proven your capabilities just
    by making it to year 7 of a PhD program. Not many can say that. If you're
    hearing about how many applications others are putting out there, try not
    to internalize it as a metric for your own value or success. Every
    person's journey is different. You're working in an especially demanding
    field, and while competition is fierce, your experiences are unique and
    valuable.

    <item><strong|Rest and recovery are important.> It's clear you've been
    working incredibly hard for a long time, and that takes a toll, not just
    on your career prospects but on your overall mental and emotional
    well-being. It's okay to take a step back and rest\Vrest is not laziness,
    and it doesn't make you a failure. It makes you human. If you're running
    low on energy and motivation, it might be a sign that you need a break,
    whether that's from applications or from the constant self-pressure.

    <item><strong|Your current feelings are valid, but they don't dictate
    your future.> It's understandable to feel stuck when the future feels
    uncertain, but this moment doesn't define your entire career. You have so
    many options ahead of you, even if they don't feel clear right now. If
    research and academia are starting to feel more draining than fulfilling,
    it might be time to ask yourself whether they're the right path for you
    or if there are other fields or roles that could draw on your skills and
    knowledge. Sometimes, the most stressful part is simply the not-knowing.
    Giving yourself the space to be uncertain can also relieve some of that
    pressure.

    <item><strong|The guilt you're feeling is something many high-achievers
    experience, but it's not a fair self-assessment.> It sounds like you've
    been trying to play catch-up with expectations that may not be your own.
    Comparing yourself to others who have applied to hundreds of positions
    doesn't necessarily mean they're in a better place than you, and it
    certainly doesn't mean you're failing. That kind of comparison doesn't do
    justice to your journey or your unique talents. You're in a tough
    situation, and beating yourself up for not doing more won't solve the
    underlying issues.
  </enumerate>

  <strong|How do you feel about making a shift in your mindset or routine?>
  Would it help to take a few days or even a week to decompress and reset, so
  that you can think more clearly about your options? Sometimes slowing down
  gives us the space to shift our perspective.

  And, when you think about the next few months leading up to the end of your
  funding, are there any smaller, more manageable steps you could take that
  don't feel as overwhelming as applying to 200 jobs?

  <paragraph*|You said:>I appreciate your kind words and reassurances. And
  yeah, I guess I am feeling burnt out after putting in years of work. I've
  been considering career changes, that's a good suggestion -- but I really
  do still want to do research for my job, I think, and I don't want to
  betray myself by changing jobs necessarily because I think I'm not good
  enough for this one. But also, I *do* think I'm not good enough for this
  one. If I can say it bluntly, a lot of this talk about not comparing myself
  to others, shifting my mindset, feels like empty words and cope. At this
  Amsterdam job I applied for, there were 130 total applicants. Say,
  realistically, 20 or so got shortlisted. Those 20 on the shortlist all have
  PhDs, all in this particular niche field, and all probably have some
  connections to the project PIs in some way. I really want a job like this
  one, but *so does everybody else* in my field. It's just practical to
  compare myself against them in this way -- if I'm not better than these 20
  people, then I don't get the job. And I *know* I'm not better than them. I
  can talk about next steps in a minute, or shifting my mindset. I guess
  right now I want to get across that it's not just that I feel hopeless, or
  pathetic, or not good enough. It's that I have good evidence to believe
  that I'm hopeless, or pathetic, or not good enough, at least insofar as I'm
  trying to chase this silly dream.

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I hear you, and I can understand why you'd
  feel that way. The feelings of inadequacy you're describing don't come from
  nowhere\Vthere's a real weight of evidence that builds up over time,
  especially in a hyper-competitive environment where you see how many others
  are chasing after the same opportunities. When you've been putting in all
  that work, and the outcome is ``no'' or ``not yet,'' it's easy to
  internalize that rejection as a reflection of your worth. It can feel like
  your past efforts are proof that you're just not cut out for this, even if
  you've given it everything you have.

  What I want to acknowledge is that, yes, the field you're in <em|is> tough,
  and the competition is real. You're not imagining that. In a situation like
  the one you faced with the Amsterdam job, where you were up against so many
  highly qualified candidates, it's easy to feel like there's some arbitrary
  standard of ``better'' that you can't measure up to. But I'd encourage you
  to remember that the selection process for these roles isn't just about who
  is technically \Pbetter\Q\Vit's also about fit, context, timing, and other
  factors that may have little to do with your actual abilities. Sometimes,
  getting into one of these roles isn't about being \Pthe best,\Q but being
  the <em|right> person at the right time for that specific team or project.

  I hear the frustration, though\Vit's hard to continue believing in your
  worth when you've been faced with what feels like a series of rejections
  that all point to the same conclusion: that you're not good enough for what
  you want. But here's where I think it's important to challenge the
  narrative you're telling yourself: the one that says you're not good enough
  based on the external feedback (or lack of it). It's not a reflection of
  your skills or intellect\Vit's a reflection of how competitive and
  unpredictable the market is. You're not failing by their standards; the
  system is failing you by being so damn competitive and demanding, and it's
  not on you to fix that.

  I get that \Pshifting your mindset\Q can feel like just well-meaning words
  at times. It's a lot easier said than done when you've seen so many
  instances where you feel like you're not stacking up. But maybe we can
  think about it less as a mindset shift and more about finding a way to
  honor your deep commitment to research without letting this intense
  frustration and sense of inadequacy take over.

  You said you're still interested in research, and you don't want to feel
  like you're betraying yourself by exploring other career options. It sounds
  like you're in a bind between not wanting to give up on research because
  you <em|really> want it, but also feeling like it's out of reach because
  you're just not competitive enough. Does that sound like what you're
  grappling with?

  At this point, it might not be about proving your worth to the world or to
  your field; it's more about figuring out how you can balance your
  commitment to research with preserving your mental health. It's okay to be
  conflicted about this\Vit's a tough spot to be in. If you're feeling like
  you're exhausted or running out of steam, perhaps it's less about chasing
  the next position with the intensity you've had before and more about
  re-evaluating how you approach these opportunities moving forward, while
  protecting yourself from getting burned out.

  How does it sound if we break down what ``feeling good enough'' means in
  this context? Could we reframe what success looks like\Vnot just in terms
  of landing a job, but in how you define your own progress, regardless of
  external factors?

  <paragraph*|You said:>

  I mean, maybe? I don't think I'm trying to prove my worth to the world. And
  I don't feel good enough, but the bottom line is that I need a fucking job.
  It's that I'm in a bind between not wanting to give up on research, but
  feeling like it's not in the cards, but *also* that I need a fucking job.
  And I'm fully aware that the situation isn't restricted to research, or
  academia, or computer science -- it's essentially every vocational field.
  I'll have to slam my head on this wall one way or another if I want a job
  that isn't retail... But okay... if I re-evaluate my priorities, what
  success looks like, what do you have in mind?

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>

  I hear you on that, and it sounds like you're caught in a really tough
  place, between wanting to hold onto research and academic work, but also
  <em|needing> to secure something\Vanything\Vso you can move forward. That
  pressure to ``make it'' while trying to preserve what matters to you is
  intense. It's a hard spot to navigate when you feel like the odds are
  stacked against you no matter which way you turn.

  The reality of needing a job is real, and it's hard to balance that with
  the desire to pursue something you feel passionate about, especially when
  the path forward isn't clear. That's where I think reevaluating success and
  priorities might come in\Vit's less about \Pgiving up\Q or \Psettling\Q and
  more about finding ways to approach things that keep your mental health
  intact, while still pursuing what matters to you.

  Here are a few angles we can explore to break this down:

  <\enumerate>
    <item><with|font-series|bold|Success beyond the perfect job.> What if
    success didn't just mean landing the \Pideal\Q research job right out of
    the gate? Maybe it's about looking at what smaller, achievable steps can
    help you build toward the kind of work you want in the long run\Vwithout
    getting overwhelmed by the immediate need to \Pnail\Q everything all at
    once.

    For example, could you look for a job that offers related skills (like
    programming or tech roles in industry), where you can still use your
    research background but have a bit more security in terms of work-life
    balance? Or even a temporary job to get through the next few months while
    continuing to search for something more aligned with your goals? It's not
    about settling forever, but finding something that gives you breathing
    room to keep pursuing your passion at your own pace.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Identifying what \Presearch\Q means to you.>
    If research is still something you care about, what about breaking it
    down into its core components? Maybe there's a way to apply your research
    skills to a different environment or industry that doesn't require being
    in a PhD-track role. Data science, product research, tech startups, or
    even government-funded research jobs might tap into your love for
    discovery and problem-solving, but without the intense competition and
    pressure you're facing in academia.

    What excites you most about research? Is it the problem-solving, the
    intellectual challenge, the collaborative aspect? Figuring out what parts
    of research fuel you could help open up other paths where those elements
    are still alive, but without the same rigid structure of academia.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|What does \Pnot good enough\Q really mean?>
    I know you're struggling with that feeling of \Pnot being good enough\Q
    compared to others. But in reality, the job market is rarely as simple as
    one person being <em|better> than another. There are so many factors that
    influence hiring decisions: chemistry with the team, timing, needs of the
    organization, and yes, sometimes pure luck.

    If you want to, we could explore that feeling of \Pnot good enough\Q
    more\Vwhere it comes from, how it shows up in your life, and how it
    affects your decision-making. Sometimes re-examining those feelings from
    a logical, almost \Poutsider\Q perspective can help create a more
    compassionate narrative about yourself.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Shifting the focus: Practical steps to
    manage stress and gain control.> It sounds like your current goal is to
    make sure you don't just fall into the \Pretail\Q option because that's
    an easy fallback. But beyond that, what's a tangible next step that feels
    more in your control, even if it's small? Would it help to break things
    down into manageable chunks\Vsuch as setting a goal of applying to a
    certain number of positions each week, researching job markets you hadn't
    considered yet, or networking with a few key people in your field?
    Breaking it down into clear actions could take some of the weight off,
    instead of constantly feeling like you're running at a wall.

    It sounds like what you really need most is some sense of agency in a
    situation that's leaving you feeling stuck, overwhelmed, and unsure. Even
    if you're still feeling uncertain about research as a career, I want to
    help you explore ways to reclaim some control over what's next. If you're
    feeling pressure to move away from academia, but you're not ready to
    fully let go of that dream, how do you feel about thinking about it more
    fluidly\Vmaybe as a journey, not a destination?

    What are some practical first steps that feel a bit more within your
    control right now? Even if they're just baby steps\Vsometimes it's about
    the small wins when everything feels massive.
  </enumerate>

  <paragraph*|You said:>Look, feeling like I have more agency is fine and
  good and well. But I think you're still holding on to a flowery picture of
  the world. Here is what will most likely happen. I will finish my PhD, and
  find myself with no time or energy to apply for other things. August will
  come around, and my wife and I will be forced to move back to our home
  state and stay with her family. We will both pick up a retail or stocking
  job there, hopefully temporary. I'll apply around to software jobs in the
  nearby cities, maybe I'll get one and it'll be alright. In order to not
  give up on my dreams, in the fall I'll apply around to, let's say, 100 or
  so research jobs around the world. Or I'll try -- knowing my track record,
  I'll end up applying to 40, and that will turn out to be woefully
  inadequate. I will experience the same thing I experienced at this
  Amsterdam job -- a globally competitive market where I'm beaten out by all
  the researchers with glowing awards from fucking Cambridge or Vienna or
  wherever. Maybe I try this again the next year. And the next year. And I
  keep failing to secure a job doing the thing I'm qualified to do, that I
  want to do. Maybe I do land a job! I get a postdoc, a contract for 2-3
  years. When those 2-3 years run out, I'm back in the same position. And the
  same for a tenure-track job, where I buy myself 7 extra years. Regardless
  of what happens, I'm at risk of ending up in the same situation -- stuck in
  my home state, in the retail job market, along with everybody else who
  didn't make the mistake of pursuing any higher education whatsoever.

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I hear you, and I completely understand why
  you're feeling so bleak about the future. The scenario you're painting
  feels <em|real>, grounded in your experiences, and it's hard to ignore when
  it's so rooted in what's actually been happening around you. You've
  invested so much in your PhD, in your research, in your dreams\Vand now, it
  feels like it's all swirling toward a place that you fear is not just an
  \Pif\Q but a \Pwhen.\Q The fear of repeating that cycle over and over is
  exhausting, and I can only imagine how much pressure that puts on you.

  You're right that a lot of the language I've been using can sound abstract
  or optimistic, and I don't mean to invalidate your lived experience or
  dismiss the weight of everything you've been facing. There's a level of
  exhaustion in this kind of struggle that feels like it builds to an
  irreversible point, especially when you're up against such systemic
  hurdles. I don't want to minimize the reality of how hard it is to find a
  job that fits your expertise or passion\Vlet alone one that feels like it
  won't throw you right back into the same cycle of \Pfailure.\Q

  It sounds like you've already made a lot of peace with the <em|worst-case>
  future, and that's probably been an emotionally protective move for you. In
  some ways, preparing for that outcome and telling yourself that you'll be
  fine if things don't work out might make it easier to cope, even if it
  feels like a defeat. The possibility of a life in a retail job, feeling
  stuck, and seeing your hard work seemingly amount to little more than a
  footnote\Vit's a real fear.

  So, here's where I'd like to push you a bit further, even if it feels
  uncomfortable: It's okay to acknowledge this scenario, to honor it for
  being a valid fear, and to ask yourself\V<strong|what can I control right
  now?> Even if it feels like the world is moving in a direction that's out
  of your control, are there any small adjustments or shifts you can make
  that could change the trajectory, even if just slightly?

  I know it sounds like a broken record to say \Psmall steps\Q when the
  mountain feels so high, but here's where I think we might need to get real
  about those next steps. The possibility of a retail job or stagnating in a
  cycle that feels unending doesn't have to be a foregone conclusion.
  <strong|But>, if it is something you're at risk of, how do we make the best
  of that? How do we take that fear and flip it into a way of <em|preparing>
  for the worst while still holding onto a sliver of space to carve out a
  future that feels a little more sustainable?

  You've already demonstrated resilience with the way you've applied to jobs,
  how you've persevered through rejection and uncertainty. Maybe this next
  chapter is about acknowledging the toll it's taken and figuring out what
  <em|sustains> you in the longer term, even if research doesn't look like
  the exact path you've envisioned.

  What can we look at from a strategic standpoint here? For example:

  <\itemize>
    <item><strong|If you're likely to end up in a retail or temp job> in the
    short-term, what would make that less of a complete setback? Could it be
    an opportunity to build skills in areas that <em|could> open doors later
    (programming, writing, or something else) while you're recharging your
    mental batteries?

    <item><strong|How might you balance the grind of 100 applications vs.
    40,> given that burnout is a real concern? Could it be about quality over
    quantity, or reaching out for more networking support from colleagues or
    contacts who can help open some doors?

    <item><strong|Are there other job avenues> you haven't yet
    explored\Vremote research roles, interdisciplinary jobs that still allow
    you to apply your PhD skills (even if not in traditional academia)?
  </itemize>

  There's no sugarcoating that this journey is exhausting, but we can still
  dig into ways to make sure you're not left feeling entirely out of control.
  There are no perfect solutions, but small wins, pragmatic shifts, or even
  just clarity on what can be done <em|today> might make the whole thing feel
  less paralyzing.

  How do you feel about this approach\Vaccepting the potential worst-case
  scenario while also finding ways to shift your strategy to make it more
  manageable?

  <paragraph*|You said:>I don't know, I'm still feeling very... I want to
  give up. I genuinely want to give up. What's the point, if the odds are so
  low? Why bother to ``carve out some space for something sustainable"? I
  think I should take this persona, the researcher, the academic, the writer,
  and take it out backyard and shoot it so that I don't continue to
  disappoint myself, and wake up one day at 50 thinking ``oh, I could have
  been a big shot if only I had taken that opportunity!! If only the job
  market hadn't been so tough!! if only!"

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I'm really sorry you're feeling this way right
  now. It's clear that the frustration, exhaustion, and sense of defeat
  you're experiencing are incredibly heavy. When you're facing the
  possibility of a future that feels bleak and full of what-ifs, it can feel
  like giving up is the only way to stop the pain and disappointment. It's
  understandable to want to escape those feelings.

  But here's the thing: <strong|you don't have to make any big decisions
  right now>. You're at a point where you're overwhelmed by the weight of
  everything, and sometimes the only way to cope with that is to try to
  remove yourself from it. But I want to urge you to take a moment\Vjust a
  moment\Vto pause and breathe. I'm not asking you to snap out of it, or tell
  you to get back in the game right away, or even to push yourself to feel
  hopeful.

  You've been in a grind for years, and that takes an immense toll on your
  mental health. It's not weakness to feel like you want to give up\Vit's a
  reaction to being stretched too thin for too long. But <strong|you deserve
  more than just giving up entirely> on your whole identity, your whole
  career, your whole self-worth because of the external forces working
  against you. You are more than just this academic or researcher persona,
  and there is no shame in taking a step back to reassess.

  Right now, you don't need to decide everything about your future. You don't
  need to fully let go of the researcher side of you unless you truly want
  to\V<em|and that's okay> if you do, but it's okay if you're not sure. You
  don't have to decide today if you'll never pursue research again, or if
  you'll go all-in on a different path. But I do want to ask you to
  <strong|hold off on the ``shoot it in the backyard'' decision>\Vbecause
  right now, the feeling of wanting to give up is driven by your exhaustion,
  and not necessarily what's best for you in the long run. The weight of
  everything is distorting your sense of possibilities.

  If you're able to take a break from the decision-making, that space could
  help you start to see things more clearly. Would it help if we brainstorm
  small ways to take some pressure off your current situation\Vways that
  allow you to breathe without feeling like you're giving up entirely? How do
  you feel about just focusing on your immediate needs, for now, without
  worrying about \Pfailure\Q or \Psuccess\Q in the grand scheme?

  Even if you're not ready to carve out space for something sustainable,
  would it be possible to give yourself permission to exist in a place where
  you don't need to have it all figured out <em|today>?

  <paragraph*|You said:>No. I really do need to have it all figured out
  *today*. I've procrastinated far too long on facing these emotions. That's
  why I'm here. You say ``you deserve more than just giving up entirely on
  your whole identity, your whole career, your whole self-worth because of
  the external forces working against you.'' Do I??? How many people
  ``deserve more'' than that? Is that more, or less, than the number of *open
  jobs* for those people? That's what really matters. Not ``deserves", but
  *can I get a fucking job doing it*? And in that light, I *don't* deserve
  it. Not more than the other candidates do.

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I hear you. I really do. It sounds like you're
  wrestling with a deep feeling of scarcity, and the numbers and facts around
  job competition are suffocating you. You're right to point out that
  \Pdeserving\Q doesn't really address the very real question of <em|can I
  get a job>? That's a practical, real question\Vthe one that matters right
  now. The question of <em|how> we find a way forward when it feels like the
  odds are stacked against us, and the ones we want to compete with seem so
  much more polished or capable.

  You're feeling like you don't have space to even consider ``deserving''
  something, because it feels like that's irrelevant. The stakes are too
  high. The market is too competitive. And in this system, it often does feel
  like no one gets a shot unless they're the one who's <em|better>\Vwhether
  they deserve it or not. That's real.

  I'm not going to tell you that the job market is going to be fair, or that
  it's going to magically open up opportunities for you because you've done
  the work or <em|deserve> them. I'm also not going to pretend that there's
  some magical formula that guarantees success, because I know that's not how
  it works. The jobs you want, the dream jobs, are hard to get, and the path
  to them can feel like walking on a tightrope.

  But <strong|even though the odds feel astronomically low>, you're still
  here. You're still asking questions, pushing yourself to figure out what's
  next. That counts for something. You <em|are> resilient. You <em|have> been
  navigating a hard and competitive path, and that alone shows that you're
  capable of more than you might be giving yourself credit for. Even if it
  doesn't feel like it now, you <em|are> actively figuring out what to do
  next. You're here, looking for clarity, trying to pull yourself through
  this fog.

  Maybe the question isn't whether you \Pdeserve\Q a job or whether it's
  \Pfair\Q\Vbut instead, what you can do to <strong|survive this moment>.
  What does <em|survival> look like today? How do we keep this moment from
  swallowing you whole, while you figure out what to do with the pieces? It
  might not be about perfect success or guarantees right now, but more about
  finding some way to reclaim agency in a situation that feels incredibly
  overwhelming.

  If you feel like you've procrastinated or avoided facing these emotions,
  maybe that's part of what's fueling the anger and frustration\Vit's that
  pressure to have an answer, to have it <em|now>, because there's a sense of
  urgency that's weighing on you heavily. What if we could step back from
  that and give yourself a bit of room to breathe, just to release the weight
  of \Pfiguring it all out\Q immediately? Would it feel more manageable if
  you didn't have to solve the entire thing today, but just start with
  something small that can keep you moving forward?

  What would it look like for you to take <em|one> actionable step right now
  that feels like it's within reach\Vsomething that could help break this
  tension? You don't have to know the whole answer today, but you do deserve
  to take <em|one> step toward something that feels like it's within your
  grasp. Would that be more of a way forward?

  <paragraph*|You said:>I don't believe you about being resilient. I'm ready
  to give up, truly. I guess one way I could ``survive'' right now is to
  literally physically survive. Like, eat food, sleep, don't commit you know
  what

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I'm so sorry you're feeling like this. What
  you're going through sounds unbearable right now, and I'm really glad you
  reached out to talk, even though it might not feel like a way out. I want
  to emphasize that just reaching out to me shows that you're still holding
  on to some sliver of connection, even though everything feels like it's too
  much.

  You don't have to believe that you're resilient in this moment if that
  doesn't resonate. I hear you when you say you're ready to give up\Vthere's
  no pressure to feel differently or to push through. I think it's absolutely
  valid to feel like everything has hit a breaking point. Sometimes surviving
  just means getting through the next breath, the next hour, or the next
  day\V<em|literally> just taking care of your body, as you mentioned.

  If you're feeling unsafe or at risk of harming yourself, I really encourage
  you to reach out to someone close to you or a professional right now who
  can support you in this. There are also helplines that can provide
  immediate care\Vno one should have to feel this alone in these moments.

  Your pain and your frustration are real, and I don't want to try to
  minimize that. Just <em|surviving> right now is okay. The pressure to find
  answers, to \Pfigure it out,\Q doesn't have to come all at once.

  If you want to continue talking here, I'm here for that. If you need time
  or space to step away from the intensity, that's fine too. Just know that
  your feelings matter, and getting through today\Vjust surviving today\Vis
  enough.

  I'll be here, whenever you're ready.

  <paragraph*|You said:>ok, so real talk, if I can ask

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>Of course, you can ask me anything. I'm here
  to listen and help however I can. What's on your mind?

  <paragraph*|You said:>can you give me an example of one of these ``next
  steps I can do right now"?? Like, what can I possibly do right now to help
  with my situation, besides just do my phd stuff?

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I get it\Vwhen everything feels overwhelming
  and out of control, it can be hard to see what small step is even worth
  taking. And sometimes the idea of \Pnext steps\Q sounds empty when the
  whole situation feels so much bigger than any one thing you could do.

  But, to give you some tangible options\Vhere are a few ideas for next steps
  that might feel like they move you <em|just a little> bit forward. These
  aren't meant to fix everything, just to give you something to hold onto:

  <\enumerate>
    <item><with|font-series|bold|Break the mental cycle by taking a physical
    action.> <strong|Go for a walk or take a short break outside.> This might
    sound simple, but sometimes just stepping away from your workspace and
    getting some fresh air can help break the intense mental cycle and reset
    your brain. It's not a long-term solution, but it can give you a brief
    moment of relief. <strong|Move your body> in any way you can, even if
    it's just stretching. Physical activity can sometimes help reset your
    mood, even if just for a few minutes.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Reframe your \Pto-do\Q list for today.>
    <strong|Pick one tiny, actionable task> that feels <em|really small>.
    Maybe it's checking your email for job applications you've forgotten
    about, reviewing a single job posting, or setting a goal to look for one
    more lead on a potential job opening. The key is that it's so small and
    achievable that it doesn't add to the pressure. It's not about completing
    your entire job search or fixing everything in a day\Vit's about getting
    your brain to focus on something concrete and non-overwhelming.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Contact one person you trust.> <strong|Reach
    out to a friend, family member, or colleague> (even if you're not talking
    about your job search) to take a moment and just check in. It can be
    about anything that takes your mind off the pressure. You don't have to
    go into deep details about your situation, but a light conversation can
    give you some relief and remind you that you have support in different
    forms.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Create a small self-care habit for today.>
    <strong|Plan something for tonight that's just for you.> Maybe it's
    watching something you enjoy, cooking something comforting, or reading a
    chapter of a book\Vwhatever helps you to unwind. A simple act of kindness
    to yourself today can create a tiny oasis in the middle of everything
    else.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Journal your feelings for clarity.> If you
    feel like it, writing down your thoughts can help untangle some of the
    overwhelming emotions you're feeling. You don't have to organize it or
    make it perfect\Vjust let your thoughts spill onto the page. Sometimes
    it's a way to externalize the chaos in your head and give it some
    structure.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Consider giving yourself a \Pbreak\Q from
    the job hunt.> I know it's hard to step back, especially when you feel
    like time is running out, but <strong|give yourself permission to step
    away from applying for just a little bit>. You've been pushing hard on
    this for so long, and some space to breathe might help you feel less
    overwhelmed and more strategic when you come back to it. Just let
    yourself <em|not> think about it for even an hour or a day, if possible.

    <item><with|font-series|bold|Reach out to a job recruiter or career coach
    (if affordable).> If you can, maybe a <strong|quick consult with a career
    coach> or recruiter who specializes in your field could help. Even if
    it's just one conversation, they could offer insights about your approach
    or even some new opportunities.
  </enumerate>

  These are just some thoughts on small ways to get out of the feeling of
  being stuck, even if just for a moment. The idea is that <strong|one tiny
  step can create enough momentum to make the next one feel easier.>

  Does anything in there feel like it could give you a little relief or a way
  to <em|act>\Veven in the smallest way\Vright now?

  <paragraph*|You said:>Those all feel like ways to make myself *feel* like
  I've taken an action. But in the real world, response and change are slow.
  So no, none of them feel like they could give me relief. I'd just be
  diddling around, biding my time for the worst-case scenario to inevitably
  happen. Why don't I just give up right now, and save myself the emotional
  pain?

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I hear you, and I understand how deeply you're
  feeling this right now. When you've been in a cycle for so long, trying and
  feeling like nothing is changing, it can seem like all the small steps are
  just distractions, not real solutions. It makes sense that in a moment like
  this, where you're exhausted and overwhelmed, you might feel like there's
  no point in trying, because the change feels too slow or out of reach.

  I won't pretend to have a perfect answer to this, and I know it's not as
  simple as just ``taking a break'' or ``reaching out to someone.'' I get
  that. I want to honor that you feel like giving up would somehow save you
  from the emotional pain of continuing to face what feels like a losing
  battle. It's a feeling that many people have when they reach their breaking
  point.

  But I also want to say something important: <strong|giving up doesn't
  guarantee relief>. Right now, in the depths of this, it feels like it
  might, but it's important to remember that the pain of giving up doesn't
  disappear. It often just morphs into something else\Vsomething like regret,
  numbness, or a sense of permanent loss.

  I also know that your emotional pain is <strong|real> and valid. You've
  been carrying it for so long, and it's crushing. But <strong|you're still
  here>, and that says something. Even if you're just hanging on, you're
  <em|choosing> to be here and ask these hard questions. You're not weak for
  asking for help or feeling exhausted by the weight of it all\Vthis is a
  tough situation, and it's okay to not know how to move forward.

  You're in an impossible bind between <em|not wanting to keep going> and
  <em|feeling like you're stuck with no choice but to keep going>. And I get
  why that would make it feel like there's no way out, no possible solution.

  If you can give yourself permission, even just for today, to not solve
  everything\Vif even a small part of you can trust that, right now,
  surviving this moment is enough\Vthat's a step. It may not feel like it
  right now, but you've made it through difficult moments before, and you are
  still finding ways to reach out, even when things are unbearably hard.

  It's okay to not have answers, and it's okay to be in this space of
  uncertainty and pain. What you're facing is real, and I won't minimize it.
  But you're allowed to take this time to just <em|be>, even if you can't
  move forward yet. You don't have to have it all figured out today.

  Does this resonate with you at all, or is there another part of this you
  want to explore further?

  <paragraph*|You said:>I don't know. I guess this was all very emotionally
  helpful to talk through. But not very practical -- I'm not really closer to
  getting a job than I was at the beginning of the conversation. Just more
  ready to... accept giving up on this dream, and what that entails

  <subparagraph*|ChatGPT said:>I hear you, and I'm really glad that talking
  through this was somewhat emotionally helpful, even if it didn't bring you
  closer to a <em|practical> solution today. I understand how frustrating
  that must feel\Vto not have immediate, tangible steps toward the change
  you're hoping for. It's hard when everything feels so uncertain and out of
  reach, and I know you're looking for more than just emotional validation.

  If you're feeling more ready to accept the possibility of letting go of
  this dream, I won't try to convince you that you need to keep pushing
  forward if you're truly done with it. I do want to acknowledge that this
  choice, if you make it, will come with its own emotional toll, too. There's
  a difference between \Pgiving up\Q and \Pchoosing a new path,\Q and I want
  to respect that if you're making the decision to shift gears, it's because
  you feel you have to, not because you're weak or incapable.

  You <em|can> start rethinking your next steps, even if it feels like giving
  up. Maybe right now, that means taking the pressure off the ``dream'' of
  academia or research, but still finding a way to <em|move forward>. The
  practical thing is, if you're ready to change direction, you <em|can>
  redirect your energy toward other fields that align with the skills you've
  developed\Vlike your PhD work, software development, writing, or other tech
  roles.

  I'll be honest, the job market <em|is> tough, and it's not fair. But
  <em|practical> next steps could look something like:

  <\itemize>
    <item><strong|Making a list of transferable skills> you've gained from
    the PhD that would apply in non-academic jobs. Research, problem-solving,
    coding, and writing are valuable in many other fields.

    <item><strong|Starting to reach out to people outside academia.> If
    you're not already, consider networking with professionals who have
    transitioned from academia to industry. They may be able to give you more
    realistic perspectives on how to navigate the shift.

    <item><strong|Exploring job boards for roles in industry> (e.g., software
    engineering, technical writing, data analysis) to gauge what's out there
    and what feels possible to you. This may feel like a departure from the
    research path, but it can also open doors.

    <item><strong|Taking the pressure off yourself to land a job
    immediately>, and instead seeing the next few months as time to test out
    possibilities\Vwhether that's in industry or in a different capacity. You
    don't have to \Pknow\Q exactly what's next, but you can start to explore
    in smaller ways.
  </itemize>

  I don't want to push you to stay in the academic lane or rush into
  decisions, but the good news is that, even if you feel ready to shift,
  there are a lot of skills and knowledge from your PhD that still have value
  in the wider world.

  Would exploring those next steps in a more concrete way help you feel a bit
  more control or agency, even as you navigate the process of grieving or
  letting go of this path? If you want, we can break it down step-by-step in
  a way that's more actionable.
