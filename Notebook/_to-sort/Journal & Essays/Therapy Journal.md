- Good side of perfectionism: List-making, being on top of things, high achievement, being on top of things, good writing, attention to detail
- Dark side of perfectionism: Controlling my environment, controlling people, judging people, overly concerned with safety + comfort of cats, high pressure for absurdly high expectations for myself, giving up when things stop being perfect
- Dialogue between parts of myself:  Part 1 judges other people, Part 2 is ashamed of Part 1 for judging, Part 3 (more adult?) thinks Part 2 is right for feeling shame, but knows that the shame is unhealthy too
- Decision to make OCD assessment.  The goal isn't necessarily a diagnosis, but to see what things I need to have control over
- Blind spots:  What parts of my personality/perfectionism/etc. am I totally blind to?  Am I actually judgmental?  How much do I control people?  How much do I need control?  What things am I not aware that I obsess over? etc.

### 9/20/23
- Started OCD evaluation
- Goal of evaluation is the *process*, and understanding the nature of my obsessions/compulsions, *not* a diagnosis (not a yes/no answer)
- Got through "aggressive" compulsions (hurting others, etc.)

Ugh I'm so pent up with shame and rage and Big Vent Energy
I might just vomit it all out here later tonight when I'm at a keyboard
it sucks, it's starting to eat away at me because I don't just fucking talk about it.  I've been angry all day, and anxious for three weeks straight
just got out of the car from our 10-hour road trip, and the rage has mellowed out into a dull ache as usual
bleehh I'm still going to vomit (words, I mean) 
This is going to be long-winded and whiny as shit, and pales in comparison to most of you guys' problems.  I've thought about journaling bc I don't have an outlet to get this anxiety and angst out, but I can't sit comfortable with myself at a keyboard with only myself as the audience
So I'm just gonna dump shit here, make a little thread I think so that I don't take away from the real things y'all need to vent.  Feel absolutely no pressure to read or even reply to any of this, only read this if you're getting something out of it, etc. etc. 
So I'm angry at myself again
[1:53 AM]
And I'm filled to the brim with anxiety, running away from a Very Important Work Email™
[1:53 AM]
and running away from work in general
[1:55 AM]
I've said this here before, but for context:  I'm a PhD student and I'm done with classes, which means I'm just doing research for the foreseeable future.  So my work schedule is extremely flexible, and I don't have a lot of responsibility.  (Yes, I'm very very aware of the privilege I've had to be in this situation, and that consequently my problems are like 0th world problems compared to the vast majority of CPTSD survivors.  Please just ignore me if I'm excessively whiny or ungrateful for your taste, I'm just throwing myself an indulgent pity party.) (edited)

So if, for example, I stopped showing up to the office 4 weeks ago, nobody would fire me
[1:56 AM]
And if, for example, I stopped doing any work at all 3 weeks ago, still nobody would fire me (or even notice)
[1:56 AM]
And if, for example, I stopped getting out of bed 2 weeks ago, only my wife and cats would notice at all

Caleb — Today at 2:00 AM
And if, for example, I then fucked off to South Carolina to go to my mother-in-law's wedding, go to a giant family reunion, catch up with a couple of friends, and so on, I would have to explicitly say it for my advisors to notice anything happened at all (edited)
[2:01 AM]
They had no idea until we had a Zoom meeting located in my mother-in-law's art room.
[2:02 AM]
What nobody tells you is that when you're bed-ridden depressed and you want to die, and then you're ripped from the comfort of your sad-sack pillow, is that you're still depressed but now you have put on a good face for your friends and family (edited)
[2:03 AM]
look like I actually like the guy my mother-in-law is marrying, and be a rock for my wife who's way more distraught about their marriage than I could possibly imagine
[2:03 AM]
mission fucking success, actually
[2:03 AM]
just want to self-congratulate lol, I pulled that off.  She had no idea something was wrong until today
[2:04 AM]
but that's important, because that week was for her and her mom.
[2:06 AM]
Ok, so now I've lost the trust of my advisors.  This isn't the first time I've dropped off and stopped communicating with them.  And every time I do, I lose about a month's worth of productivity.  So how the fuck can they trust me in the future to be an Independent Researcher™??
[2:06 AM]
They can't.  I know they can't.  They know I know.
[2:07 AM]
Ok, but now I just need to re-earn their trust, right?  Easy!

Caleb — Today at 2:08 AM
Except there's that important work email.  Sent while I was camping the day after my mother-in-law's wedding (we wanted to give her and her new husband some space, obviously, the night of their wedding.  This was when we were staying by our friends' amazing VW)
[2:08 AM]
The important work email.
[2:08 AM]
Some philosophy professor from a town over got in contact with my advisor
[2:08 AM]
now wants to meet up and show us some new neural network architecutre
[2:08 AM]
cool cool, might be the next best thing, might be vaporware
[2:09 AM]
he coded it in FUCKING EXCEL, the madlad
[2:09 AM]
so he sends a probe email
[2:09 AM]
one of my advisors replies
[2:09 AM]
the other replies
[2:09 AM]
everyone's replying in paragraphs that I feel like I don't have time to really read right now, since I'm waking up in a different bed every night
[2:11 AM]
but then a week passes, and I still haven't read the email chain (now many, many emails long) (edited)
[2:12 AM]
So now I've absolutely proven to my advisors that I can't even do the basic fucking tasks required of me
[2:13 AM]
I'm supposed to be going up for postdoc applications this year, for fuck's sake, but I can't even answer an email in a 24-hour window.  For all my advisors know, I'm dead in SC somewhere
[2:14 AM]
-------------------------------------------------

And now I've drilled down to the bottom of it (edited)
[2:14 AM]
It's imposter syndrome, right?  "I'm not good enough for my job, under the surface I'm really just faking it!"

Caleb — Today at 2:15 AM
But it's not just imposter syndrome, it's deeper (edited)
[2:17 AM]
It's the sense that I'm broken.  And I'm broken in a particular way that will make me forever terrible at keeping up with work contacts, with writing papers without bingeing them, with getting work out without demanding that it's perfect, with networking and job applications and interviews and all the other things that make for a successful career
[2:17 AM]
And that part isn't so sad, because fuck a corporate career, honestly
[2:19 AM]
But these things make for a successful academic, for a successful researcher, and I've baked it into my fucking identity for the last 10 years that I've always wanted to be an academic, that this is what my bones and DNA and life experience and personality and neurodivergence and education and interests were fucking made for
[2:19 AM]
It's not just the email, and it's not just the depression
[2:19 AM]
and it's not just the job hunt
[2:19 AM]
I think I'm afraid to face the thing that I love
[2:20 AM]
In the fear that I'll find out I'm not cut out for it
[2:20 AM]
Like
[2:20 AM]
My advisor sent me a postdoc position in Milan, where the job description was fucking exactly what I've trained myself to do
[2:20 AM]
(and fwiw, what I love doing)
[2:21 AM]
Essentially:
foundations of AI
nonmonotonic reasoning
logics for belief revision
[2:21 AM]
where else are you going to find a job description that fucking perfect?

Caleb — Today at 2:22 AM
and my wife and I have always wanted to live in the EU
[2:22 AM]
but I'm scared
[2:23 AM]
I'm scared I'll do 75, or 200, or 400 applications
[2:26 AM]
and discover only after 400 rejections that I'm not good enough
[2:26 AM]
and then I'll have wasted 3 years of my life living in poverty wishing on a dream
[2:27 AM]
after having wasted 7 years of my life on a PhD
[2:27 AM]
or maybe I'll find out I'm not good enough when I don't get tenure track after my 3rd postdoc, like many people in the system

Caleb — Today at 2:31 AM
all because I'm inconsistent, forget about things easily, and get dysregulated around authority figures.  Because I'm a perfectionist, I fear failure, and I'm afraid to ask people for help.  Because I feel ashamed of myself, I get depressed, and I hole myself up in my room wishing that people forgot about me.  Because I hate having any impact on people's lives whatsoever.
[2:31 AM]
ok, there it is, all laid out in the open
[2:31 AM]
fuck

mads (please ping) — Today at 5:35 AM
shrug, as someone with a brain issue separate from any mental health issues i have that makes me work on a delay this all sounds pretty familiar 
but it wouldn't be out of place in any other mental health chats i've been in either
Caleb — Today at 6:08 PM
No yeah that's fair, like I said, it's peanuts compared to most of the issues people here have
I don't even know why I'm making a big deal out of it, or complaining at all
Caleb — Today at 6:17 PM
what do you mean by "work on a delay"?

### 12/14/23
I've been recovering more memories these days, trying to uncover "major life events" that shaped me. one memory that came up: I was 10yo, playing a game of live-action Pokemon with my friend in his backyard. My sisters and his sisters were doing their own thing, but would pass through the backyard every now and then. For some reason I was really self-conscious about pretending to be in a Pokemon tv show, so whenever they did I would freeze up, go silent, and wait until they left. This happened maybe 5 times, and then I snapped. I lost it. I just started punching myself repeatedly in the face screaming "shit! shit! shit! shit!" incessantly for I don't know how long. I don't remember how I got home, but when I did, it was "go to your room. Right. Now." And so I waited in bed for 30 minutes, sobbing and sobbing. Then my mom comes in and asks me "do you know what you did wrong?" So I cry and tell her I'm so so sorry for cursing and I'll never curse again, etc. etc. (this all was a very familiar routine, it's go to your room, explain what you did wrong, all with the tone that I'm a terrible child that deserves punishment) Her response? "No. No, I don't care about you cursing. But I need to punish you because you hit yourself. You know better than that." (edited)

I think my two takeaways from that experience were:
- I'm fundamentally broken, normal people don't freak out like that
- Hitting is always wrong, context is irrelevant
and I think I still carry those conclusions with me as an adult.  But I think if I could sit my 10yo self down post-meltdown, the takeaways I'd stress are:
- I have special needs and explosive emotions that other people don't know how to handle, and **that's okay!**
- It is **good** to feel and let out anger.  But I need outlets for my anger that *don't* hurt myself or worry/hurt the people around me.

2/16/24
I'm a failure.  I'm not cut out for academia.  Why do I think my work is going to be some big success?  I can't even regulate my emotions properly, let alone prove some hard math problem.  I only do the work I do to get attention -- and then once I have that attention, I don't follow through.  I don't respond to emails as soon as I need to, and my flakiness causes me to lose connections with people who would otherweisljf]a09ejfal;wejfa;lejf ;oawiej fo;awjefio;ajw 0e9rj Q[0RWJW[0J O;ASJEF; OIJ;LJ;ljsd;lafjas;fdsafd]asdf]asdfafdasdfasdfasdff
