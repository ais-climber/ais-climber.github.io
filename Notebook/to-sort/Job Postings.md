## Postdoc & Early Career Researcher Postings

### Tallinn University of Technology
https://candidate.recrur.com/public/jobad/en/6fe08182-2
Applications due **September 14, 2024**

**Short description:** A two year postdoc starting on 1 January 2025 in the Compositionality group at the Tallinn University of Technology. The position would suit a category theorist interested in computer science, and especially in applications in probability theory, logic, verification and AI.

**Full description:** The Department of Software Science invites applications for a postdoctoral researcher position in Diagrammatic Probabilistic First-order Logic for Safeguarding AI.

First-order logic has a recent string diagrammatic complete axiomatisation [1] in terms of first-order bicategories. At the same time, the morphisms of the Kleisli category of the finitary subdistribution monad have posetal structure given by a point-wise ordering. This structure is similar to the one of the regular fragment of first- order bicategories.

These observations point towards an extension of partial Markov categories [2] to a probabilistic analogue of cartesian bicategories of relations and first-order bicategories, with potentially richer 2-cells. Such structure could be further developed to incorporate traces, which would give a syntax for deriving statements for probabilistic processes analogous to Hoare triples for non-deterministic processes.

We intend this work to be a step towards an expressive formalism for the specification and reasoning about probabilistic systems, including systems that include AI compoments.

**Application documents:**
- a motivation letter; 
- documents proving that the candidate holds the required academic degree for the position applied; 
- a CV, including a list of publications;
- an academic portfolio, including a motivated self-evaluation regarding compliance with the [requirements](https://oigusaktid.taltech.ee/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TT_Akadeemilise_karjaari_matrix_tabel2.pdf?_ga=2.257875659.1992148516.1718602849-832543129.1614077652) for the researcher position set out in the Academic Career Management Regulation, Annex 3 [“Academic Evaluation Matrix”](https://oigusaktid.taltech.ee/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TT_Akadeemilise_karjaari_korraldus-EN_lisa3_tabel1.pdf?_ga=2.257875659.1992148516.1718602849-832543129.1614077652) (shall be submitted by a university staff member only) or a free format evaluation of the academic activity undertaken so far and the competencies required for work (shall be submitted by an external candidate only) detailing how the candidate meets the qualifications of the position; 
- other documents considered important by the candidate.

### Open Rank Posting, Princeton Linguistics
"For fullest consideration, please apply by **October 18, 2024**."
Applications open **September 1, 2024**
**Note:** It's worth emailing them and asking if they would be interested in a similar position for a postdoc. (I am a good match for the call/posting, but I'm looking for a postdoc position at the moment). Or maybe don't sell myself short? idk, ask someone for help with this

The Program in Linguistics at Princeton University invites applications for one open-rank faculty position (tenure-track Assistant Professor, tenured Associate Professor, or tenured Full Professor), beginning September 1, 2025. **The ideal candidate will study language from an interdisciplinary,  computational perspective, using formal tools (e.g. probabilistic modeling, neural networks, information theory) to study linguistic phenomena, especially including language processing and/or language learning.** We are particularly interested in a scholar working at the interface of linguistics on the one hand and cognitive science and/or computer science on the other hand (e.g., computational cognitive science, natural language processing). A strong background in theoretical linguistics as well as cognitive/computer science is a plus.

Interested candidates must apply online with the following materials:
 - A cover letter,
 - An up-to-date curriculum vitae,
 - Two representative scholarly papers,
 - A research statement,
 - A teaching statement,
 - Teaching evaluations (if available), and
 - Contact information for three references.

### Bilateral AI Project
https://www.bilateral-ai.net/
Call for applications opens **September 1, 2024**

**Austrian Science Fund** is funding a cluster for Bilateral Artificial Intelligence
Call for 10 postdocs, to join one of six Austrian research institutes:
- Johannes Kepler Universität Linz (**JKU Linz**)
- Technische Universität Wien (**TU Wien**)
- Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt (**AAU**)
- Institute of Science and Technology Austria (**ISTA**)
- Technische Universität Graz (**TU Graz**)
- Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien (**WU Wien**)

**Board of directors:**

**Description:**
In BILAI, major Austrian players in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are teaming up to work towards Broad AI. As opposed to Narrow AI, which is characterized by task-specific skills, Broad AI seeks to address a wide array of problems, rather than being limited to a single task or domain. To develop its foundations, BILAI employs a Bilateral AI approach, effectively combining sub-symbolic AI (neural networks and machine learning) with symbolic AI (logic, knowledge representation, and reasoning) in various ways.  
  
Harnessing the full potential of both symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches can open new avenues for AI, enhancing its ability to solve novel problems, adapt to diverse environments, improve reasoning skills, and increase efficiency in computation and data use. These key features enable a broad range of applications for Broad AI, from drug development and medicine to planning and scheduling, autonomous traffic management, and recommendation systems.  
  
Prioritizing fairness, transparency, and explainability, the development of Broad AI is crucial for addressing ethical concerns and ensuring a positive impact on society.
