A collection of ideas I have for writing. Ideas might come in the form of an essay, a little note, a blog post, or a full-on paper.  I think about ideas as flowing in stages.  In each stage, my mind rewrites and reorganizes the ideas from the previous stage --- you can think of each stage as a new edit/revision of the idea, until it's finally ready for the world.  Here's how I personally like to divide the stages:

- **Stage 0: Idea pops in my head.**
- **Stage 1: I write the idea down.**
	- As bullet points / scrawls on a paper.  It's okay to wait until the idea is 'ripe', this is often the most fun passion-filled part of the process.
	- My favorite ideas are the ones were we *know* one of two/three cases must be true, but we don't know which one.
- **Stage 2: I write up a notes file in research notebook.**
	- Usually I wait until I have 1) a working title, 2) a specific problem statement / question I want to answer, 3) basic math definitions / software I'm building off of, and 4) *some* progress or ideas on how to answer the question.  These all go in my Research_Notebook/ repo as .tex files.
- **Stage 3: I turn the notes into a proper draft.**
	- I wait until I have 1) results, i.e. theorems or experimental results that answer the question in one direction or another, and 2) an example that makes the intuition easy for the reader, that cuts through all the results, and 3) some extra application or follow-up result that says something more
- **Stage 4: I share the draft with peers.**
	- Here I just wait until the thing is written up, and resembles a paper.  I might go through a couple rounds of revision by myself, but it's important to get it out there sooner rather than later.

### Ideas
- When I have time, give serious thought to applying my work/insights to DeepProbLog (e.g. what would dynamic update look like? Model building? Would I have to lift things to FOL first?)

### Just for Fun / Blog post ideas
- Make a "Fun" page on my website, include a post where I talk a bit about how I used to make video games (often with my sister). Include RPG Maker/OHRRPGCE game (whatever I can get a hold of, including the game review), various other projects that died in different game making engines. Thomas tkinter game. Mention, my sister went on to make a bunch of experimental games hosted on itch.io, I'm hoping one day I get the muse back again (but these days my inspiration seems to be about highly technical things). This is a sort of retrospective letter to my younger self.
- On Fun page, include a blurb where I talk about Sabrina and my DIY wedding, and include photos & the invitations
