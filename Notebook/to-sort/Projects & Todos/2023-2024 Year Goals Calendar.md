#### April 2023
- [x] **[Learning/Exploring]** Prove Prop + Reach properties in Lean
#### May 2023
- [x] **[Learning/Exploring]** Prove Minimal Cause + Hebb properties in Lean
- [ ] > **[Arxiv]** Finalize & upload Arxiv draft of FLAIRS paper
#### June 2023
- [x] **[AAAI 2024]** Prove complete description for Hebb (in Lean)
#### July 2023
- [x] **[AAAI 2024]** Prove remaining properties for Hebb & Reach in Lean
#### August 2023
- [x] **[AAAI 2024]** Write Hebbian logic paper & proofs
- [x] **[AAAI 2024]** Submit paper!
- [x] **[AAAI 2024]** Clean up code & proofs for supplemental material
- [x] **[Thesis]** Rewrite Lean code to use Reach instead of conditional reach
- [x] **[Thesis]** Recover the minimal cause property, and try to write it (in comments) as a K+T axiom (for K+T completeness)
#### September 2023
- [ ] **[FLAIRS Errata]** Correct all lemmas from the FLAIRS paper in Lean, and write errata
- [ ] **[Thesis]** Prove completeness for the base logic (K+T) in Lean
- [ ] **[AAAI 2024]** Remove all 'sorry's from Lean code for Hebbian learning
#### October 2023
- [ ] **[Exploratory]** Define the 4 obvious supervised belief revision policies and prove their reduction axioms are sound in Lean
- [ ] **[Exploratory]** Start on supervised belief revision, get high-level details straightened out: 
	- Define several obvious supervised belief revision policies, prove reductions
	- what the logic + syntax mean in terms of learning
	- at least one policy that cannot be reduced to unsupervised learning (maybe it can in the base language?)
	- what we learn by studying policies like this (e.g. global vs local updates; what kinds of supervised learning can be reduced to unsupervised learning)
	- other things I should prove about them; how are these different from other 'comparative' belief revision operators?
	- what is a 'killer feature' of these logic operators?
- [ ] **[AAAI 2024]** Respond & revise to reviewer feedback
#### November 2023
- [ ] **[AAAI 2024]** After reviewer feedback, write full paper with proofs & upload to Arxiv
- [ ] **[Arxiv]** Finally put FLAIRS full paper (with proofs) together and post on Arxiv
