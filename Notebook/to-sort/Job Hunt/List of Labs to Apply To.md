## S Tier - Dream Job Labs
**Requirement:** $\geq 5$ *non-retired* faculty/research staff that I would be *very* interested in working with & talking shop with over lunch.



## A Tier - Reasonably Good Fit Labs
**Requirement:** $3 - 4$ *non-retired* faculty/research staff that I would be *very* interested in working with & talking shop with over lunch.

## B Tier - Keep An Open Mind
**Requirement:** $1 - 2$ *non-retired* faculty/research staff that I would be *very* interested in working with & talking shop with over lunch.  (There's a chance of schedule clash / personality clash / time-and-place clash, so I might end up lonely.  I may not have anybody to eat lunch with, or I may have to create community.)

## To Sort
- **[Academic]** Institute for Logic, Language and Computation
- **[Academic]** Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy
- **[Academic]** Stanford AI Lab
	  Also worth mentioning the Logical Dynamics Lab, via the CSLI (Center for the Study of Language and Information)
- **[Academic]** ACS-ML at City, University of London
	  This is Artur Garcez' lab for neuro-symbolic AI.  It's been home to many big names in neuro-symbolic AI, including Simon Odense (former PhD student) and Tarek Besold (former assistant professor).  This lab is famous for essentially founding neuro-symbolic AI, and more recently for collaborating with Sony AI on the Logic Tensor Networks paper.
	  **Current Interesting Faculty:** Artur d'Avila Garcez, Laure Daviaud, Jacob Howe
- **[Academic]** Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science at University of Edinburgh
	  I believe this is where Wen from wen.works is.  See their website, which shows *several* super-interesting people https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/people/academic-staff
- **[Academic]** Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven
	  *Several* interesting people here, all working on reasoning in AI.  This is where Luc De Raedt is (creator of DeepProbLog), and they also do work on machine learning verification.  Looks like a very interesting group of *a lot* of logic people.

- **[Academic; Nonprofit]** Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition
	  See https://www.ihmc.us/research/computational-and-philosophical-foundations/
	  They apparently are interested in work on 1) extracting meaning/semantics from neural models, 2) reasoning about preferences, and 3) non-monotonic logics
- **[Industry]** Sony AI Lab
	  Very popular lab for neuro-symbolic researchers, including Tarek Besold, Michael Spranger, Samy Badreddine.  This lab is famous for collaborating with City, University of London on the Logic Tensor Networks paper.
- **[Industry]** IBM Neuro-Symbolic AI (research theme)
	  & MIT-IBM Watson Lab
- **[Industry]** Microsoft RiSE Initiative
	  Especially work on Lean, verification, and neuro-symbolic AI
- **[Industry; Startup, research]** Redwood Research Center
	  This lab is specifically funded for work on interpreting neural networks.  They are "especially interested in practical projects that are motivated by theoretical arguments" for AI alignment. I have a pitch that would be perfect for working there -- making neural network model building *practical*, i.e. building a net that provably will never unlearn one of the rules you give it (based on my PhD work).
- **[Industry]** OpenAI
	  Another company that is very interested in interpretation/neuro-symbolic work.  The catch here is that I really need to understand how transformers/language models work before applying.
- **[Industry]** SRI International AI Center
	  They do work requiring neural-symbolic AI
