    <item>[in the style of George Carlin] "They say money can't buy
    happiness, but it sure beats the alternative: being broke and miserable."

    <item>And then there's the gym. Oh, the gym. I thought it was going to be
    a place where I could escape my problems and get in shape. But nope. It's
    just a room filled with mirrors and judgment. I mean, why do they have
    those giant fans that just blow your hair all over the place? Is that
    supposed to be some sort of workout? And don't even get me started on the
    treadmills. <with|font-series|bold|I feel like I'm in a never-ending game
    of the floor is lava, except the lava is my own sweat.>

    <item>But you know what the worst part is? When people ask how my day was
    and I'm like, 'It was fine, just the usual chaos.' And they're like, 'Oh,
    that sounds great.' And I'm just like, 'No, it doesn't. It's a mess and I
    can't keep up.' And then I realize I've been talking to a plant for the
    past five minutes.

    <item>"I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands because my ear
    got tired of carrying the weight of the notes."

    <item>"Why did the scarecrow carry a map? Because he wanted to find his
    way, but didn't want to ask for directions."
