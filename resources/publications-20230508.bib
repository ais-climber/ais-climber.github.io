For quite general coefficients and a suitable regularity of the noise we obtain, via the dimensional reduction principle discussed in our previous paper on the topic, the identity between the law of the solution to the SPDE evaluated at the origin with a Gibbs type measure on the abstract Wiener space \$L$\widehat{\text{2}}$ (M)\$. The results are then applied to the elliptic stochastic quantization equation for the scalar field with polynomial interaction over \$\textbackslash mathbb\{T\}$\widehat{\text{2}}$\$, and with exponential interaction over \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}$\widehat{\text{2}}$\$ (known also as H\{\textbackslash o\}egh-Krohn or Liouville model in the literature). In particular for the exponential interaction case, the existence and uniqueness properties of solutions to the elliptic equation over \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}$\widehat{\text{\{}}$2 + 2\}\$ is derived as well as the dimensional reduction for all values of the "charge parameter" \$\textbackslash sigma = \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash alpha\}\{2\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash pi\}\} $<$ \textbackslash sqrt\{8 \textbackslash pi\}\$ for which the model has an Euclidean invariant measure (hence also permitting to get the corresponding relativistic invariant model on the two dimensional Minkowski space).},

Analysis on Grassmann algebras is developed here from the point of view of quantum probability: a Grassmann random variable is an homomorphism of an abstract Grassmann algebra into a quantum probability space, i.e. a C\ensuremath{_{\textrm{$\ast$}}}-algebra endowed with a suitable state. We define the notion of Gaussian processes, Brownian motion and stochastic (partial) differential equations taking values in Grassmann algebras. We use them to study the long time behavior of finite and infinite dimensional Langevin Grassmann stochastic differential equations driven by Gaussian space-time white noise and to describe their invariant measures. As an application we give a proof of the stochastic quantization and of the removal of the space cut-off for the Euclidean Yukawa model, indicating also how this can be extended to other models of quantum fields.},

In this situation noise prevents shocks for the transport equation and singularities in the density for the continuity equation, starting from smooth initial conditions. Specifically, we first prove a result of Sobolev regularity of solutions, which is false for the corresponding deterministic equation. The technique needed to reach the critical case is new and based on parabolic equations satisfied by moments of first derivatives of the solution, opposite to previous works based on stochastic flows. The approach extends to higher order derivatives under more regularity of the drift term. By a duality approach, these regularity results are then applied to prove uniqueness of weak solutions to linear stochastic continuity and transport equations and certain well-posedness results for the associated stochastic differential equation (sDE) (roughly speaking, existence and uniqueness of flows and their C$\alpha$C$\alpha$C$\widehat{\text{\{}}$\textbackslash  alpha \} regularity, strong uniqueness for the sDE when the initial datum has diffuse law). Finally, we show two types of examples: on the one hand, we present well-posed sDEs, when the corresponding ODEs are ill-posed, and on the other hand, we give a counterexample in the supercritical case.},

  abstract     = {We consider the ordinary differential equation (ODE) d x t = b ( t , x t ) d t + d w t where w is a continuous driving function and b is a time-dependent vector field which possibly is only a distribution in the space variable. We quantify the regularising properties of an arbitrary continuous path w on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation. In this context we introduce the notion of $\rho$ -irregularity and show that it plays a key role in some instances of the regularisation by noise phenomenon. In the particular case of a function w sampled according to the law of the fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index H $\in$ ( 0 , 1 ) , we prove that almost surely the ODE admits a solution for all b in the Besov{\textendash}H{\"o}lder space B $\infty$ , $\infty$ $\alpha$ + 1 with $\alpha$ \&gt; - 1 / 2 H . If $\alpha$ \&gt; 1 - 1 / 2 H then the solution is unique among a natural set of continuous solutions. If H \&gt; 1 / 3 and $\alpha$ \&gt; 3 / 2 - 1 / 2 H or if $\alpha$ \&gt; 2 - 1 / 2 H then the equation admits a unique Lipschitz flow. Note that when $\alpha$ \&lt; 0 the vector field b is only a distribution, nonetheless there exists a natural notion of solution for which the above results apply.},

In this paper we consider the modulated versions of the 1d periodic or non-periodic Kortewegde Vries (KdV) equation and of the modified KdV equation. For that we use a deterministic notion of "irregularity" for the modulation and obtain local and global results similar to those valid without modulation. In some cases the irregularity of the modulation improves the well-posedness theory of the equations. Our approach is based on estimates for the regularising effect of the modulated dispersion on the non-linear term using the theory of controlled paths and estimates stemming from Young's theory of integration.},

Here we provide the first intrinsic well-posedness result for the stationary KPZ equation on the real line by showing that its energy solutions, as introduced by Gonçalves and Jara in 2010 and refined by Gubinelli and Jara, are unique. This is the first time that a singular stochastic PDE can be tackled using probabilistic methods, and the combination of the convergence results of the first work and many follow-up papers with our uniqueness proof establishes the weak KPZ universality conjecture for a wide class of models. Our proof builds on an observation of Funaki and Quastel from 2015, and a remarkable consequence is that the energy solution to the KPZ equation is not equal to the Cole-Hopf solution, but it involves an additional drift .},

Our goal in this paper is two-fold. (i) By introducing a hybrid argument, combining the $I$-method in the stochastic setting with a Gronwall-type argument, we first prove global well-posedness of the (renormalized) cubic SNLW in the defocusing case. Our argument yields a double exponential growth bound on the Sobolev norm of a solution. (ii) We then study the stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) in the defocusing case. In particular, by applying Bourgain's invariant measure argument, we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the (renormalized) defocusing SdNLW with respect to the Gibbs measure and invariance of the Gibbs measure.},

Apart from deriving a basic existence and uniqueness result for paracontrolled solutions to the KPZ equation we perform a thorough study of some related problems. We rigorously prove the links between the KPZ equation, stochastic Burgers equation, and (linear) stochastic heat equation and also the existence of solutions starting from quite irregular initial conditions. We also show that there is a natural approximation scheme for the nonlinearity in the stochastic Burgers equation. Interpreting the KPZ equation as the value function of an optimal control problem, we give a pathwise proof for the global existence of solutions and thus for the strict positivity of solutions to the stochastic heat equation. Moreover, we study Sasamoto{\textendash}Spohn type discretizations of the stochastic Burgers equation and show that their limit solves the continuous Burgers equation possibly with an additional linear transport term. As an application, we give a proof of the invariance of the white noise for the stochastic Burgers equation that does not rely on the Cole{\textendash}Hopf transform.},

The text comprises three lectures covering: the theory of stochastic Hamilton{\textendash}Jacobi equations, one of the most intriguing and rich new chapters of this subject; singular SPDEs, which are at the cutting edge of innovation in the field following the breakthroughs of regularity structures and related theories, with the KPZ equation as a central example; and the study of dispersive equations with random initial conditions, which gives new insights into classical problems and at the same time provides a surprising parallel to the theory of singular SPDEs, viewed from many different perspectives. These notes are aimed at graduate students and researchers who want to familiarize themselves with this new field, which lies at the interface between analysis and probability.},

  abstract     = {Written by leading experts in an emerging field, this book offers a unique view of the theory of stochastic partial differential equations, with lectures on the stationary KPZ equation, fully nonlinear SPDEs, and random data wave equations. This subject has recently attracted a great deal of attention, partly as a consequence of Martin Hairer's contributions and in particular his creation of a theory of regularity structures for SPDEs, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014. The text comprises three lectures covering: the theory of stochastic Hamilton{\textendash}Jacobi equations, one of the most intriguing and rich new chapters of this subject; singular SPDEs, which are at the cutting edge of innovation in the field following the breakthroughs of regularity structures and related theories, with the KPZ equation as a central example; and the study of dispersive equations with random initial conditions, which gives new insights into classical problems and at the same time provides a surprising parallel to the theory of singular SPDEs, viewed from many different perspectives. These notes are aimed at graduate students and researchers who want to familiarize themselves with this new field, which lies at the interface between analysis and probability.},

It was known that the domain must have trivial intersection with the usual cylinder test functions, and to overcome this difficulty we import some ideas from paracontrolled distributions to an infinite dimensional setting in order to construct a domain of controlled functions. Using the new domain, we are able to prove existence and uniqueness for the Kolmogorov backward equation and the martingale problem. We also extend the uniqueness result for ``energy solutions'' of the stochastic Burgers equation of Gubinelli and Perkowski (J Am Math Soc 31(2):427{\textendash}471, 2018) to a wider class of equations. As applications of our approach we prove that the stochastic Burgers equation on the torus is exponentially \$\$L$\widehat{\text{2}}$\$\$L2-ergodic, and that the stochastic Burgers equation on the real line is ergodic.},

Our argument yields a double exponential growth bound on the Sobolev norm of a solution. (2) We then study the stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) in the defocusing case.

This formula is the simplest instance of dimensional reduction, discovered in the physics literature by Parisi and Sourlas (Phys. Rev. Lett. 43 (1979) 744{\textendash}745), which links the law of an elliptic SPDE in d+2d+2d+2 dimension with a Gibbs measure in ddd dimensions. This phenomenon is similar to the relation between a $\mathbb{R}$d+1Rd+1\textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash  mathbb\{R\}$\widehat{\text{\{}}$d+1\} dimensional parabolic SPDE and its $\mathbb{R}$dRd\textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash  mathbb\{R\}$\widehat{\text{\{}}$d\} dimensional invariant measure. As such, dimensional reduction of elliptic SPDEs can be considered a sort of elliptic stochastic quantisation procedure in the sense of Nelson (Phys. Rev. 150 (1966) 1079{\textendash}1085) and Parisi and Wu (Sci. Sin. 24 (1981) 483{\textendash}496). Our proof uses in a fundamental way the representation of the law of the SPDE as a supersymmetric quantum field theory. Dimensional reduction for the supersymmetric theory was already established by Klein et al. (Comm. Math. Phys. 94 (1984) 459{\textendash}482). We fix a subtle gap in their proof and also complete the dimensional reduction picture by providing the link between the elliptic SPDE and the supersymmetric model. Even in our d=0d=0d=0 context the arguments are nontrivial and a nonsupersymmetric, elementary proof seems only to be available in the Gaussian case.},

In this situation noise prevents shocks for the transport equation and singularities in the density for the continuity equation, starting from smooth initial conditions. Specifically, we first prove a result of Sobolev regularity of solutions, which is false for the corresponding deterministic equation. The technique needed to reach the critical case is new and based on parabolic equations satisfied by moments of first derivatives of the solution, opposite to previous works based on stochastic flows. The approach extends to higher order derivatives under more regularity of the drift term. By a duality approach, these regularity results are then applied to prove uniqueness of weak solutions to linear stochastic continuity and transport equations and certain well-posedness results for the associated stochastic differential equation (sDE) (roughly speaking, existence and uniqueness of flows and their C$\alpha$C$\alpha$C$\widehat{\text{\{}}$\textbackslash\textbackslash  alpha \} regularity, strong uniqueness for the sDE when the initial datum has diffuse law). Finally, we show two types of examples: on the one hand, we present well-posed sDEs, when the corresponding ODEs are ill-posed, and on the other hand, we give a counterexample in the supercritical case.},

  abstract     = {We consider the ordinary differential equation (ODE) d x t = b ( t , x t ) d t + d w t where w is a continuous driving function and b is a time-dependent vector field which possibly is only a distribution in the space variable. We quantify the regularising properties of an arbitrary continuous path w on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation. In this context we introduce the notion of $\rho$ -irregularity and show that it plays a key role in some instances of the regularisation by noise phenomenon. In the particular case of a function w sampled according to the law of the fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index H $\in$ ( 0 , 1 ) , we prove that almost surely the ODE admits a solution for all b in the Besov{\textendash}H{\"o}lder space B $\infty$ , $\infty$ $\alpha$ + 1 with $\alpha$ \&gt; - 1 / 2 H . If $\alpha$ \&gt; 1 - 1 / 2 H then the solution is unique among a natural set of continuous solutions. If H \&gt; 1 / 3 and $\alpha$ \&gt; 3 / 2 - 1 / 2 H or if $\alpha$ \&gt; 2 - 1 / 2 H then the equation admits a unique Lipschitz flow. Note that when $\alpha$ \&lt; 0 the vector field b is only a distribution, nonetheless there exists a natural notion of solution for which the above results apply.},

  abstract     = {The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is conjectured to universally describe the fluctuations of weakly asymmetric interface growth. Here we provide the first intrinsic well-posedness result for the stationary KPZ equation on the real line by showing that its energy solutions, as introduced by Gonçalves and Jara in 2010 and refined by Gubinelli and Jara, are unique. This is the first time that a singular stochastic PDE can be tackled using probabilistic methods, and the combination of the convergence results of the first work and many follow-up papers with our uniqueness proof establishes the weak KPZ universality conjecture for a wide class of models. Our proof builds on an observation of Funaki and Quastel from 2015, and a remarkable consequence is that the energy solution to the KPZ equation is not equal to the Cole-Hopf solution, but it involves an additional drift .},

Apart from deriving a basic existence and uniqueness result for paracontrolled solutions to the KPZ equation we perform a thorough study of some related problems. We rigorously prove the links between the KPZ equation, stochastic Burgers equation, and (linear) stochastic heat equation and also the existence of solutions starting from quite irregular initial conditions. We also show that there is a natural approximation scheme for the nonlinearity in the stochastic Burgers equation. Interpreting the KPZ equation as the value function of an optimal control problem, we give a pathwise proof for the global existence of solutions and thus for the strict positivity of solutions to the stochastic heat equation. Moreover, we study Sasamoto{\textendash}Spohn type discretizations of the stochastic Burgers equation and show that their limit solves the continuous Burgers equation possibly with an additional linear transport term. As an application, we give a proof of the invariance of the white noise for the stochastic Burgers equation that does not rely on the Cole{\textendash}Hopf transform.},

In both the critical $d=2$ and super-critical $d\\\\geq 3$ cases, we show that the scaling limit of (the regularised) SBE is given by a stochastic heat equation with non-trivially renormalised coefficient, introducing a set of tools that we expect to be applicable more widely. For $d\\\\ge3$ the scaling adopted is the classical diffusive one, while in $d=2$ it is the weak coupling scaling which corresponds to tuning down the strength of the interaction in a scale-dependent way.},

In some cases the irregularity of the modulation improves the well-posedness theory of the equations. Our approach is based on estimates for the regularising effect of the modulated dispersion on the non-linear term using the theory of controlled paths and estimates stemming from Young's theory of integration.},
